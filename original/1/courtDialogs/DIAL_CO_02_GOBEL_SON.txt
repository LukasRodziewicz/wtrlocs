I tried to stop him, but that rascal kept fighting and was going to yell so loud the whole court would hear him.
$DIAL_CO_02_GOBEL_SON_002_JUDGE
Do not worry, I recognise that young man. He was the one who turned Archbishop Gobel’s life upside down.
$DIAL_CO_02_GOBEL_SON_003_BOUTIN
My name is Boutin. I am his son.
$DIAL_CO_02_GOBEL_SON_004_JUDGE
I suppose I know why you came here. You should know, however, that Gobel is no longer an archbishop and is now immune.
$DIAL_CO_02_GOBEL_SON_005_BOUTIN
Help me, please! In any way you can.
$DIAL_CO_02_GOBEL_SON_006_JUDGE
Are you deaf, boy? Did you hear what I said? Gobel is untouchable since he made an alliance with Hébert. If you had come to me sooner…
$DIAL_CO_02_GOBEL_SON_007_BOUTIN
I went to Jacques-Louis David, to Citizen Danton…
$DIAL_CO_02_GOBEL_SON_008_JUDGE
Danton will not help you, of that I am certain. Listen to me, it is over. Gobel will be a successful politician, so take your mother far from Paris and forget about everything.

My mother died a few years ago, despairing and humiliated as she pined for her love!
$DIAL_CO_02_GOBEL_SON_010_JUDGE
I really am sorry for your loss, but there is not a thing I can do. The world loves the new archbishop-apostate.
$DIAL_CO_02_GOBEL_SON_011_BOUTIN
So nobody will help me?
$DIAL_CO_02_GOBEL_SON_012_JUDGE
No, I am sorry. You have to live with that.
