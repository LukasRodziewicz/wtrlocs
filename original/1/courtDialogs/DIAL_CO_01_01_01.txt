May I remind you that you promised to join me. I have a feeling that tonight’s moon favours gamblers.
$DIAL_CO_01_01_02_002_JUDGE
Though it does not favour spouses…
$DIAL_CO_01_01_02_003_JLDAVID
God should grace us with wives who understand the importance of an evening game of dice. They should also know that the right amount of wine guarantees a lucky roll…
$DIAL_CO_01_01_02_004_JUDGE
I should go home.

Bringing a judge to the game has benefits – other players will surely not cheat.
$DIAL_CO_01_01_02_006_JUDGE
That is not a strong argument.

My name is Jacques-Louis David. I am but a humble painter, not a silver-tongued judge.
$DIAL_CO_01_01_02_008_JUDGE
You are a sly politician, Jacques.
$DIAL_CO_01_01_02_009_JLDAVID
As a politician I understand the importance of keeping promises. And you, my friend, are trying to get out of yours.
$DIAL_CO_01_01_02_C1
Keep your promise
$DIAL_CO_01_01_02_C2
Go home
$DIAL_CO_01_01_02_010_JUDGE
All right, but only for a short while.
$DIAL_CO_01_01_02_011_JUDGE
Not tonight, Jacques.
