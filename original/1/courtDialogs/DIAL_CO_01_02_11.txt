My name is Jean-Marie Roland. My name shold not be unknown to you - after all, you wiped your shoes on it during King Louis' trial.

Citizen Capet, not King…

King Louis-Auguste Bourbon, Duc de Berry. Thanks to you flinging around half-truths and speculation, everyone is calling for my head. Accusing me of corruption and treason! While you used our backs as a step-ladder on your way up the social hierarchy.

Corrupting politicians does not always work out. Danton does it, Molleville tried to, but they caught you. Happens.

I will probably be dismissed from my station. I may even end up at the guillotine. But I will make sure your head rolls right after mine! You will be my comrade in misery!

Threatening a Judge of the Tribunal is an even worse idea than supporting a despised King and corrupting politicians of the Convention.

I will get rid of your candidate for Captain of the Guard. Then I will go after you.

It took me and my wife too long to get to where we are! I will not die because of some over-boozed maggot that likes to call himself a Judge!

You will see how we wage war in Paris’s salons, you treacherous mongrel!
