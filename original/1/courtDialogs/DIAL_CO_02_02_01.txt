Do not make a fool of me! Today, Renard was found dead at the back of the Café Procope. Know that I will dig into this until I know your every wrongdoing. Every murder, deceit, and betrayal.

I can assure you that–

There is no need. Focus on assuring your family that you are not a monster, because I intend to be ruthless.
