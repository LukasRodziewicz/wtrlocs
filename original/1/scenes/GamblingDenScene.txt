$GD003_COMMENT_WELCOMEFIRST_01
I heard I would find you here. It is good to know that judges of the Tribunal share the weaknesses of the common folk.
$GD003_COMMENT_WELCOMEJUDGEWON_01
I deserve a rematch, do I not?
$GD003_COMMENT_WELCOMEJUDGEWON_02
This time it will not be so easy.
$GD003_COMMENT_WELCOMEJUDGEWON_03
I think you come here too often for a family man.
$GD003_COMMENT_WELCOMEJUDGELOST_01
I respect your determination…
$GD003_COMMENT_WELCOMEJUDGELOST_02
Saints by day, crooks by night. That’s us.
$GD003_COMMENT_WELCOMEJUDGELOST_03
My father once said that people such as us should be without flaws. Well, I dare to disagree.
$GD003_COMMENT_ROLLJUDGEWON_01
One swallow…
$GD003_COMMENT_ROLLJUDGEWON_02
This time…
$GD003_COMMENT_ROLLJUDGEWON_03
Means nothing.
$GD003_COMMENT_ROLLJUDGELOST_01
Nothing lasts forever. Only chaos.
$GD003_COMMENT_ROLLJUDGELOST_02
Everything is as it should be.
$GD003_COMMENT_ROLLJUDGELOST_03
Just a little more.
$GD003_COMMENT_GAMEJUDGEWON_01
Themis did not guide me today.
$GD003_COMMENT_GAMEJUDGEWON_02
We all lose in the end.
$GD003_COMMENT_GAMEJUDGEWON_03
I will get my revenge in court tomorrow…
$GD003_COMMENT_GAMEJUDGELOST_01
Maybe next time… If you are stubborn enough to come here again.
$GD003_COMMENT_GAMEJUDGELOST_02
You only lost your pride. A mere trifle.
$GD003_COMMENT_GAMEJUDGELOST_03
Perhaps next time we should gamble for our souls? Do you think we still have them?
$GD003_COMMENT_DRINK_01
Do you feel lonely with your addictions?
$GD003_COMMENT_DRINK_02
I see you know how to win the crowd.
$GD003_COMMENT_DRINK_03
Just be sure you do not get into debt. People love to drink for someone else’s money.
$GD003_COMMENT_DRINKBET_01
To hell with it, I get paid again next month!
$GD003_COMMENT_DRINKBET_02
The judge can surely play, yes?
$GD003_COMMENT_DRINKBET_03
Higher! Stack my coins higher!
$GD003_COMMENT_REROLL_01
Afraid to lose?
$GD003_COMMENT_REROLL_02
How much would you give to win?
$GD003_COMMENT_REROLL_03
If you think this will change anything…
$GD003_COMMENT_CANTREROLL_01
I wish I could roll again.
$GD004_MER_VER_HAN_DIAL_MER_01
Even though I appreciate the luxurious atmosphere of these places, I am still rather fond of the army’s asceticism.
$GD004_MER_VER_HAN_DIAL_JUDGE_02
The previous owner’s penchant for luxuries led to his downfall.
$GD004_MER_VER_HAN_DIAL_MER_03
I see. Shall we play?
$GD004_MER_VER_DAVID_DIAL_MER_01
Designed with class. Congratulations.
$GD004_MER_VER_DAVID_DIAL_JUDGE_02
Thank you. I entrusted the décor to Jacque-Louis David’s care. He is an artist.
$GD004_MER_VER_DAVID_DIAL_MER_03
Yes, I heard that you are friends and political allies. Shall we play?
$GD004_MER_COMMENT_GAMEJUDGEWON_01
I assumed that you would let me win to gain my trust. I am pleased to be mistaken from time to time.
$GD004_MER_COMMENT_GAMEJUDGELOST_01
I see that you will do anything to gain my trust – even lose intentionally.
$GD004_MER_COMMENT_ROLLJUDGEWON_01
These dice are crooked!
$GD004_MER_COMMENT_ROLLJUDGEWON_02
Damn it, those girls put a curse on me!
$GD004_MER_COMMENT_ROLLJUDGELOST_01
A bit of luck would not go amiss.
$GD004_MER_COMMENT_ROLLJUDGELOST_02
Come on, dice. Once more, please.
$GD004_MER_COMMENT_REROLL_01
You think this bad luck will turn around?
$GD004_MER_COMMENT_DRINK_01
I could use a drink.
$GD004_MER_COMMENT_DRINK_02
The judge can surely play, yes?
$GD005_RENARD_COMMENT_ROUND_01
Our masked friend was furious. He came to us with a beneficial deal in exchange for our help. We agreed.
$GD005_RENARD_COMMENT_ROUND_02
A dangerous, wounded man. Rejecting him would be unwise.
$GD005_RENARD_COMMENT_ROUND_03
He asked a person we know, someone we have collaborated with before, to help him kill your child. What a fool.
$GD005_RENARD_COMMENT_ROUND_04
We will bring you his head on a plate. This will be a token of our good will, and proof that it is wise to be our friend.
$GD005_RENARD_COMMENT_ROUND_05
The aristocrats will proudly return to the city any day now, and every person who has not taken our side will be dealt with.
$GD005_RENARD_COMMENT_GAMEJUDGEWON_01
You won. We will keep our promise – you will get that traitor’s head, and Paris… well, Paris will not be too happy.
$GD005_RENARD_COMMENT_GAMEJUDGELOST_01
Sooner or later every gambler learns that he has no control whatsoever. He passively observes how time pushes him into failure. A deal is a deal – you lost, so we will not tell you anything. And Paris… Paris shall get what it deserves.
$GD011_BRUNO_COMMENT_GAMEJUDGELOST_01
Silence him. It is not over yet.
$GD011_BRUNO_COMMENT_GAMEJUDGELOST_02
We are done here.
$GD011_BRUNO_COMMENT_GAMEJUDGEWIN_01
I also won the first round once.
$GD011_BRUNO_COMMENT_GAMEJUDGEWIN_02
That was pure luck.
$GD011_BRUNO_COMMENT_ROUND_01
You have killed every person that would be brave enough to face me. Thank you.
$GD011_BRUNO_COMMENT_ROUND_03
The blood is on your hands, not mine. I won again.
$GD011_BRUNO_COMMENT_ROUND_06
You think you know what it means to suffer? Wait until I show you.
$GD011_BRUNO_COMMENT_ROUND_08
You will fall and break our father’s heart. Only then will my revenge be complete!
$GD011_Dices_Last_Dialog
We settled the first score, but that is not all I have prepared for you. Far from it.
