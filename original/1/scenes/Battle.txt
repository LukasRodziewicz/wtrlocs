$TUTORIAL_BATTLE_DIALOG_01
Our rearguard clashed with the enemy and lost. They forced their way into the camp where the wounded were being tended to. We had to grab our weapons.
$TUTORIAL_BATTLE_DIALOG_02
Your brother fought like a man possessed. People were flocking to him.
$TUTORIAL_BATTLE_DIALOG_03
We had faith that reinforcements were rushing to help us. But we knew they would be too late…
$TUTORIAL_BATTLE_DIALOG_04
A bayonet went right through me. I was bleeding out, and my friends were being felled by bullets, one after another.
$GOBEL_BATTLE_OPPONENT_01

$GOBEL_BATTLE_JUDGE_02
Not against the Church, but its greedy priests. The ones who are dragging France underwater!
$GOBEL_BATTLE_OPPONENT_03
There is no difference. We will not let this stand! We should have put your heads on pikes long ago!
