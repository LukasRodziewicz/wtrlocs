Jean Renard, a 45-year-old innkeeper, has been charged with fraud. He is accused of <a name="2" class="hidden">diluting alcohol</a> in his tavern, tricking his clients into paying extra.
$GEN_009_DOC_01_01
Guests came with their minds set on a specific goal – <a name="3" class="hidden">getting roaring drunk</a>. But instead of staggering out after drinking two pitchers of wine or several pints of beer, they would sit in the inn until morning, still sober and completely penniless.
$GEN_009_DOC_01_02
The innkeeper’s fraud came to light when one of the customers <a name="4" class="hidden">discovered</a> the scam and caught the cheater in the act. The man entered the host’s cellar and witnessed him diluting the alcohol in the barrels with <a name="5" class="hidden">ordinary water</a>. As a result, customers received only four parts of what they paid for and one part from the water carrier.

My name is Jean Renard, monsieur le juge.
$GEN_009_OnStart_03
Nothing but a fraud!
$GEN_009_OnPrison_00
I sentence Citizen Jean Renard to prison! Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_009_OnPrison_01
Huzzah!
$GEN_009_OnPrison_02
Long live pure wine!
$GEN_009_OnNotGuilty_00
The verdict is… not guilty. Lead Citizen Renard out.
$GEN_009_OnNotGuilty_01
What is this? They released the fraud?!
$GEN_009_OnNotGuilty_02
This is not justice!
$GEN_009_01x02_00_QTitle
How long have you been involved in the illegal practice of diluting alcohol?
$GEN_009_01x02_00_00
How long have you been involved in the illegal practice of diluting alcohol?
$GEN_009_01x02_00_01
It’s not an illegal practice, everyone adds a bit.
$GEN_009_01x02_00_02
In your case, it was a bit of wine in the water, not the other way around.
$GEN_009_01x02_00_03
Have you been doing this for a long time?
$GEN_009_01x02_00_04
A few weeks at the most. It’s been hard to earn a living lately. I used to run an honest business. Pure wine was overspilling the glasses.
$GEN_009_01x02_00_05
Is there any proof to support your testimony?
$GEN_009_01x02_00_06
He lied to his customers. No reason he wouldn’t lie in court.

How did you feel about tricking weary Citizens?

How did you feel about tricking weary Citizens?
$GEN_009_02x05_01_01
Terrible, but all I wanted was to keep my business afloat. Others don’t mess around for sure. No diluting would be the end of me.
$GEN_009_02x05_01_02
So you decided to commit fraud so as not to lose money?
$GEN_009_02x05_01_03
If I lost my tavern, my family would starve to death.
$GEN_009_02x05_01_04
Do you have children?
$GEN_009_02x05_01_05
I do, one son and two daughters. Time to start saving up for the dowry.
$GEN_009_02x05_01_06
Then why don’t you send them to work, idiot!

Thomas Leclair. I’m a regular at Jean Renard’s establishment.
$GEN_009_03x05_03_QTitle
Do your clients drink a lot?
$GEN_009_03x05_03_00
Do your clients drink a lot?
$GEN_009_03x05_03_01
Tavern regulars usually drink a lot.
$GEN_009_03x05_03_02
So you have been selling plenty of wine.
$GEN_009_03x05_03_03
Quite a lot, yes.
$GEN_009_03x05_03_04
And yet you have been paying taxes on the amount of wine you have bought, not the amount of wine you have been selling, correct?
$GEN_009_03x05_03_05
I don’t understand.
$GEN_009_03x05_03_06
You have been paying taxes on four wine barrels, but by adding a quarter of water to each, have actually made the money for selling five barrels of wine.
$GEN_009_03x05_03_07
That’s one way of putting it… Perhaps it is correct… I’m not too good with numbers.
$GEN_009_03x05_03_08
You are not good with numbers, yet good enough to have calculated that fraud pays off?
$GEN_009_03x05_03_09
I wasn’t aware…
$GEN_009_03x05_03_10
I will take that answer into account.
$GEN_009_03x05_03_11
The judge has exposed the bastard!
$GEN_009_WIT_00_A_QTitle
How long have you suspected that something was wrong with Mr Renard’s alcohol?
$GEN_009_WIT_00_A_00
How long have you suspected that something was wrong with Mr Renard’s alcohol?
$GEN_009_WIT_00_A_01
I became suspicious around a month ago. Plenty of wine jugs were emptied, but instead of getting more drunk I was just getting sober. It was already dawn when I realised I had no money left on me and I was as sober as a baby.
$GEN_009_WIT_00_A_02
How was that possible?
$GEN_009_WIT_00_A_03
Back then, I didn’t realise customers were being served a proper first drink then receiving more and more water in the drinks after that – being slightly drunk, they weren’t able to notice the difference.
$GEN_009_WIT_00_A_04
Was it like that every time?
$GEN_009_WIT_00_A_05
Every single time.
$GEN_009_WIT_00_B_QTitle
How did you catch Citizen Renard in the act of diluting wine with water?

How did you catch Citizen Renard in the act of diluting wine with water?
$GEN_009_WIT_00_B_01
I was having one drink after another, so I had to... you know, monsieur le juge...
$GEN_009_WIT_00_B_02
I know.
$GEN_009_WIT_00_B_03
So it happened that one time I got lost and instead of… you know… I ended up in the cellar, where I saw Renard adding water to the barrels.
