	Percivall Hill, a 54-year-old British physician permanently residing in Paris, has been accused of numerous murders of his patients. The doctor’s activities drew the attention of the medical world when Parisian bookshops and stands began to sell his book entitled “Treatise on the Structure and Development of Tumours."
$GEN_055_DOC_01_01
	This publication contains <a name="3" class="hidden">numerous engravings</a> that detail <a name="4" class="hidden">growths</a> appearing both on the skin and internal organs of patients. As we were able to ascertain from booksellers, this item, although addressed to a specific audience, quickly <a name="5" class="hidden">disappeared from their shelves</a>.
$GEN_055_DOC_01_02
	Around one month after the treatise appeared in print, 12 Parisian doctors made a joint denunciation of the author. In their opinion, at least three-quarters of the patients on whom Hill performed <a name="7" class="hidden">an autopsy</a> had no reason to die at such an early stage of the disease. Hence the conclusion that he had to kill them to conduct the research.
$GEN_055_DOC_01_03
	The physician’s office, located in Section de la Fraternité, has been thoroughly searched. The treatment room was empty and cleaned, however we came across some interesting information in <a name="8" class="hidden">notes from Dr Hill’s assistant</a>.

	The twelfth autopsy performed this month was a complete success. A tumour had just begun to develop in François Mallet’s colon. We were able to detect it at a very early stage, unknown so far to science. Now we have to choose a patient presenting with the disease at stage two, or maximum three, and “obtain them” for our research.
$GEN_055_OnStart_00
It seems that Dr Hill has forgotten that science is meant to serve people, and not the other way around.
$GEN_055_OnStart_01
Are you Dr Hill, the author of the “Treatise on the Structure and Development of Tumours”?
$GEN_055_OnStart_02
I am.
$GEN_055_OnStart_03
You are accused of killing your own patients. Do you wish to say something in your defence?
$GEN_055_OnStart_04
I plead not guilty.
$GEN_055_OnStart_05
Then how would you explain the large number of autopsies carried out in your office?
$GEN_055_OnStart_06
If I only had a trusted helper in Paris, I could perform many more.
$GEN_055_OnStart_07
A doctor’s role is to treat the living, not cut up the dead!
$GEN_055_OnStart_08
Were all your patients killed by tumours?
$GEN_055_OnStart_09
Not all, no. Some of those unfortunate souls died from infections, accidents, or during drunken brawls.
$GEN_055_OnGuilty_00
Dr Hill, your activities were criminal and disgusting. I sentence you to death.
$GEN_055_OnGuilty_01
He deserves to be cut up too!
$GEN_055_OnPrison_00
Citizen, your goals were noble, but your methods… I sentence you to prison.
$GEN_055_OnPrison_01
It’s not enough!
$GEN_055_OnPrison_02
Send that monster to the guillotine!
$GEN_055_OnNotGuilty_00
I only see envious people casting false accusations on Dr Hill. Doctor, I wish you luck in the further fight against this disease. You are free to go.
$GEN_055_OnNotGuilty_01
What’s that supposed to mean?
$GEN_055_OnNotGuilty_02
Did he kill them or not?
$GEN_055_OnNotGuilty_03
I’m not sure I understand.
$GEN_055_03x07_00_QTitle
Was your research time-consuming?
$GEN_055_03x07_00_00
Was your research time-consuming?
$GEN_055_03x07_00_01
Of course. The drawing alone takes an extremely long time.
$GEN_055_03x07_00_02
I understand that you also needed money to carry out those examinations.
$GEN_055_03x07_00_03
Indeed, it would be difficult to finance them with a medical practice alone.
$GEN_055_03x07_00_04
Then how did you get the money?
$GEN_055_03x07_00_05
From my British publisher, Harold Walter Smith. We signed a contract for the publication, and he gave me an advance payment on the remuneration.
$GEN_055_03x07_00_06
Anyone who takes money from the British is a traitor!
$GEN_055_03x07_00_07
I stay away from politics…
$GEN_055_03x07_00_08
Do not dare play dumb. Cooperating with British publishers during a time of war with Britain is politics, and perhaps even treason!
$GEN_055_05x04_01_QTitle
Has your book exhausted the topic of growths?
$GEN_055_05x04_01_00
Has your book exhausted the topic of growths?
$GEN_055_05x04_01_01
On the contrary, we will be studying this disease for years to come.
$GEN_055_05x04_01_02
By killing people?
$GEN_055_05x04_01_03
Keep silent when you have no idea what you are talking about.
$GEN_055_05x04_01_04
Citizen, I will silence people in this court, not you.
$GEN_055_05x04_01_05
I apologise, ignorance vexes me.
$GEN_055_05x04_01_06
So you plan to continue your research?
$GEN_055_05x04_01_07
Of course. I will do whatever it takes and will not rest until I find a weapon that kills this monster.
$GEN_055_05x04_01_08
So you will continue to murder, and you admit it openly?!
$GEN_055_05x04_01_09
I work for the sake of science, not gravediggers! As well as against dunces like those behind me and this very prosecutor!
$GEN_055_05x04_01_10
If the Judge doesn’t take that monster down, we will!
$GEN_055_04x07_02_QTitle
What were the growths you studied?
$GEN_055_04x07_02_00
What were the growths you studied?
$GEN_055_04x07_02_01
They are tumours. The Romans called this disease cancer. It is a terrifying condition.
$GEN_055_04x07_02_02
Is it lethal?
$GEN_055_04x07_02_03
Yes, the afflicted die in agony.
$GEN_055_04x07_02_04
Is it a widespread condition?
$GEN_055_04x07_02_05
Quite so, but equally often the patient lives with it for years and dies without ever knowing that their body was invaded by this deadly disease.
$GEN_055_04x07_02_06
Nonsense and quackery!
$GEN_055_04x07_02_07
Ignoramuses! You have no idea what is good for you!
$GEN_055_04x07_02_08
Watch your words, or in no time you will end up sent to the guillotine by those you are insulting!
$GEN_055_04x07_02_09
Ordinary people should not be allowed to speak on matters of science.
$GEN_055_06x03_03_QTitle
You have performed nearly 150 autopsies. How do you explain that?
$GEN_055_06x03_03_00
You have performed nearly 150 autopsies. How do you explain that?
$GEN_055_06x03_03_01
There were many more, but fewer than 150 proved suitable for publication.
$GEN_055_06x03_03_02
Please explain how it is possible that you were able to find so many bodies fitting the subject of your book.
$GEN_055_06x03_03_03
I must have been lucky.
$GEN_055_06x03_03_04
He is downright arrogant!
$GEN_055_06x03_03_05
Were all of them your patients?
$GEN_055_06x03_03_06
No, I went to hospitals and looked for people complaining of specific ailments whom I suspected to have the disease.
$GEN_055_06x03_03_07
And then you waited for them to die?
$GEN_055_06x03_03_08
Yes.
$GEN_055_08x01_04_QTitle
Call in Louis Delon.
$GEN_055_08x01_04_00
Call in Louis Delon.
$GEN_055_08x01_04_02
Are you Louis Delon, Dr Hill’s assistant?
$GEN_055_08x01_04_03
Indeed, I am.
$GEN_055_08x01_04_04
Your employer has been accused of murdering his own patients. What do you have to say about this?
$GEN_055_08x01_04_05
They all came to him for help and he tried to do his best. There is nothing more to say.
$GEN_055_08x01_04_06
So all the cases from the book were Dr Hill’s private patients?
$GEN_055_08x01_04_07
Yes, monsieur le juge.
$GEN_055_02x05_05_QTitle
Has your book sold well?
$GEN_055_02x05_05_00
Has your book sold well?
$GEN_055_02x05_05_01
I am not complaining. The first batch has almost sold out.
$GEN_055_02x05_05_02
Have you made money from it?
$GEN_055_02x05_05_03
People, he killed all of them to line his own pockets!
$GEN_055_02x05_05_04
Of course, but that is irrelevant.
$GEN_055_02x05_05_05
What is relevant, then?
$GEN_055_02x05_05_06
This disease has taken more lives than fires and wild animals put together. We need to learn about it before it kills us all. By keeping me here, you are delaying progress! Future generations will be sure to hold it against you.
$GEN_055_02x05_05_07
Were you ready to kill to learn about the disease?
$GEN_055_02x05_05_08
Every new piece of knowledge is a hundred saved lives in the future.
$GEN_055_02x05_05_09
Please answer the question.
$GEN_055_02x05_05_10
I would not know, as I have never had to make such a decision.
$GEN_055_08x03_06_QTitle
Your assistant’s notes state that you sought specific patients for your drawings.
$GEN_055_08x03_06_00
Your assistant’s notes state that you sought specific patients for your drawings.
$GEN_055_08x03_06_01
I wanted to include various examples of tumours. The disease presents differently when attacking the lungs compared to when it affects the bladder. This is important for science.
$GEN_055_08x03_06_02
Allow me to quote the notes: “We have to choose a patient … and ’obtain’ them for our research.” This does not sound like you were waiting for the right patient to die.
$GEN_055_08x03_06_03
That fool’s notes are his private matter. I do not know a thing about them.
$GEN_055_08x03_06_04
It seems that you must know something about it.
$GEN_055_08x03_06_05
I have nothing more to say on the matter.
$GEN_055_08x03_06_06
A monster, not a doctor!
$GEN_055_WIT_00_A_QTitle
Did the patients’ relatives agree to the autopsies?
$GEN_055_WIT_00_A_00
Did the patients’ relatives agree to the autopsies?
$GEN_055_WIT_00_A_01
Yes. This way, they did not have to pay a doctor.
$GEN_055_WIT_00_A_02
That sounds like blackmail.
$GEN_055_WIT_00_A_03
Rather it was a fair deal. They were mostly poor people, so for them it was like manna from heaven.
$GEN_055_WIT_00_A_04
Such benefactors!
$GEN_055_WIT_00_B_QTitle
You said in your notes that you had to obtain a new patient for your research.
$GEN_055_WIT_00_B_00
You said in your notes that you had to obtain a new patient for your research. How should I understand those words?
$GEN_055_WIT_00_B_01
…
$GEN_055_WIT_00_B_02
Answer the question.
$GEN_055_WIT_00_B_03
It was just a figure of speech.
$GEN_055_WIT_00_B_04
How did you obtain patients for your research?
$GEN_055_WIT_00_B_05
We waited until they died in an accident or…
$GEN_055_WIT_00_B_06
Or?
$GEN_055_WIT_00_B_07
Or from disease, that’s all. I was only an assistant.

Continue to kill science then, sympathising with those for whom there was no hope anyway. Would you have saved them? Will my death save others?
$GEN_055_UNIQUE_QUESTION_00
