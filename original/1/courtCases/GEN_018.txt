The defendant is Antoine Barnave, a 32-year-old politician and <a name="1" class="hidden">famous orator</a>. Parisians remember him for his fiery speech defending the constitutional monarchy. He is known as a fierce enemy of the Republic and protector of the King. Seeing that his political efforts were fruitless, he joined the National Guard.
$GEN_018_DOC_01_01
In 1791, during the notorious flight to Varennes, the Capets were detained by the Guard. Antoine Barnave and two other soldiers were ordered to <a name="3" class="hidden">escort</a> the fugitives back to Paris.
$GEN_018_DOC_01_02
When Barnave met <a name="4" class="hidden">Marie Antoinette</a>, he was absolutely <a name="5" class="hidden">charmed</a>. The two developed a, potentially sexual, relationship. Later, they were frequently writing to each other. In her letters, Marie Antoinette often expressed hope for the survival of absolute monarchy.
$GEN_018_DOC_01_03
Not long after, Barnave joined the Jacobins, hoping to help the Capets and alleviate the radical approach of the Revolutionaries towards Citizen Capet and Marie Antoinette. His efforts, however, were futile.
$GEN_018_DOC_01_04
Due to his <a name="6" class="hidden">sympathy towards the monarchy</a> and the Capets, especially Marie Antoinette, he was under constant surveillance. Now we have finally managed to collect enough evidence against him to file an indictment.
$GEN_018_DOC_01_05
One of the pieces of evidence is his correspondence with Marie Antoinette, which potentially proves his Counter-Revolutionary tendencies. Antoine Barnave ought to be punished like any other enemy of the Revolution!
$GEN_018_DOC_01_06
Evidence: <a name="8" class="hidden">Letters</a> Barnave wrote to Marie Antoinette.
$GEN_018_DOC_02_00
Your Highness! I am certain that our shared efforts will convince the people of France to preserve the Monarchy. The loss of Your wisdom and kindness would be too tragic a blow for the state to afford.  Yours, Antoine
$GEN_018_OnStart_00
He fell in love with Marie Antoinette!
$GEN_018_OnStart_01
Are you Mr Antoine Barnave?
$GEN_018_OnStart_02
I am.
$GEN_018_OnStart_03
Did you and your mistress, Marie Antoinette, plot against France?
$GEN_018_OnStart_04
There are so many lies in your question that I cannot decide which one to deny first.
$GEN_018_OnStart_05
He tries to defend himself with pretty words.
$GEN_018_OnStart_06
So you are not pleading guilty?
$GEN_018_OnStart_07
Of course not.
$GEN_018_OnGuilty_00
I have no further questions, thank you.
$GEN_018_OnGuilty_01
I sentence Citizen Antoine Barnave to death by guillotine.
$GEN_018_OnGuilty_02
Justice is served at last!
$GEN_018_OnGuilty_03
That’s how every court should operate. Swift and bold!
$GEN_018_OnPrison_00
I have no further questions, thank you.
$GEN_018_OnPrison_01
I sentence Antoine Barnave to prison! Take the condemned away and lock him in a cell.
$GEN_018_OnPrison_02
I hope his time there will not be easy.
$GEN_018_OnPrison_03
He was lucky!
$GEN_018_OnPrison_04
How can you be so easy on enemies of the state?!
$GEN_018_OnNotGuilty_00
I have no further questions, thank you.
$GEN_018_OnNotGuilty_01
I find no guilt in Antoine Barnave’s behaviour. Everyone has the right to their own political views in the Republic.
$GEN_018_OnNotGuilty_02
Do you serve the Revolution or not?
$GEN_018_OnNotGuilty_03
That judge will soon lose his seat!
$GEN_018_OnNotGuilty_04
Absurd!
$GEN_018_OnNotGuilty_05
What’s he even doing here?!
$GEN_018_01x02_00_QTitle
Not long ago you were on the path to a grand career. I remember your famous speech…
$GEN_018_01x02_00_00
Not long ago you were on the path to a grand career. I remember your famous speech in defence of Citizen Capet. Your charisma could have taken you to the top, but instead you are here. Do you not regret it?
$GEN_018_01x02_00_01
That speech was not aimed against the Revolution! I only wished to appeal to common sense.
$GEN_018_01x02_00_02
Many remember that performance as an attack on everything that started in France on 14 July.
$GEN_018_01x02_00_03
Nonsense, the changes were essential. Constitutional monarchy is a reasonable alternative to the old order.
$GEN_018_01x02_00_04
So in your opinion people who brought misery to France should continue living in a palace?
$GEN_018_01x02_00_05
I do not think they should be guillotined only for their ancestry.
$GEN_018_03x04_01_QTitle
You escorted the fugitive royals back to Paris.
$GEN_018_03x04_01_00
You escorted the fugitive royals back to Paris. Did you see an opportunity to use your new friends for your personal gain?
$GEN_018_03x04_01_01
Absolutely not! I saw hounded, terrified people, and I decided to plead for them.
$GEN_018_03x04_01_02
Where were you when we were hounded by them?
$GEN_018_03x04_01_03
Maybe you were driven by your desire for Marie Antoinette? The circumstances were not very romantic but… who knows…
$GEN_018_03x04_01_04
That is an unnecessary and false insinuation that has nothing to do with the case.
$GEN_018_03x04_01_05
I wonder if Capet liked to watch them…
$GEN_018_06x07_02_QTitle
Were you not afraid to openly support the monarchs on the eve of the Revolution?
$GEN_018_06x07_02_00
Were you not afraid to openly support the monarchs on the eve of the Revolution? That could be interpreted as treason.
$GEN_018_06x07_02_01
I may by young and idealistic, but I am no traitor!
$GEN_018_06x07_02_02
If that were true, you would be standing on the right side.
$GEN_018_06x07_02_03
I love this country and I am certain that the Republic which the Revolutionaries are fighting for is not a panacea.
$GEN_018_06x07_02_04
If you fight the Republic, you fight France itself!
$GEN_018_02x08_03_QTitle
It would appear that in your letters to Marie Antoinette, you tried to convince her…
$GEN_018_02x08_03_00
It would appear that in your letters to Marie Antoinette, you tried to convince her and her husband to support the Revolution. What would you gain from that?
$GEN_018_02x08_03_01
I believed that we would avert the terror we are currently facing.
$GEN_018_02x08_03_02
Why do you think there is terror in our country?
$GEN_018_02x08_03_03
I would not be standing here now otherwise.
$GEN_018_02x08_03_04
You’re there because you’re a Royalist swine!
$GEN_018_02x08_03_05
The Capets were not interested in the constitution?
$GEN_018_02x08_03_06
Unfortunately not.
$GEN_018_02x08_03_07
And how would you benefit from it?
$GEN_018_02x08_03_08
I only wanted what was best for my country.
$GEN_018_01x03_04_QTitle
Why did the Guard choose you to escort the Capets?
$GEN_018_01x03_04_00
Why did the Guard choose you to escort the Capets?
$GEN_018_01x03_04_01
Within the Guard, one does not question orders. They ordered me to carry out a task, and that is what I did.
$GEN_018_01x03_04_02
So you did not ask for it?
$GEN_018_01x03_04_03
How could I have? I only learned about Citizen Capet’s escape when they gave me the order.
$GEN_018_01x03_04_04
Yet you profited from it, did you not?
$GEN_018_01x03_04_05
Considering where I am standing, I do not really think so.
$GEN_018_05x04_05_QTitle
Why did Marie Antoinette make such an impression on you when you first met her?
$GEN_018_05x04_05_00
Why did Marie Antoinette make such an impression on you when you first met her?
$GEN_018_05x04_05_01
She is an incredibly well-mannered and sophisticated woman. I would have been blind not to see it.
$GEN_018_05x04_05_02
He fell for her like a youngster!
$GEN_018_05x04_05_03
Really?
$GEN_018_05x04_05_04
Marie Antoinette is a married woman and I am a decent man. You can come to your own conclusions.
$GEN_018_05x04_05_05
I heard rumours that she did not really care for her wedding ring.
$GEN_018_05x04_05_06
And you are aware that rumours are not the best source of knowledge?
$GEN_018_05x08_06_QTitle
Did you ever express your feelings to Marie Antoinette in your letters to her?
$GEN_018_05x08_06_00
Did you ever express your feelings to Marie Antoinette in your letters to her?
$GEN_018_05x08_06_01
Did you not read our letters carefully? I would not have dared to woo the Queen of France!
$GEN_018_05x08_06_02
You wrote about her wisdom and kindness. It sounds like you were paying her compliments.
$GEN_018_05x08_06_03
Those were just pleasantries.
$GEN_018_05x08_06_04
Maybe she was wooing him? The Austrian whore was insatiable.
