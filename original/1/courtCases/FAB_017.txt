The one who will face truth and justice today is Georges Danton. The list of his alleged faults is long, but as an investigator I have been able to gather convincing evidence.
$FAB_017_DOC_01_01
Firstly, there are the <a name="1" class="hidden">accusations of corruption</a>. Danton has never explained where he obtained the money that he used to purchase several properties – the farm of Nuisement that totals more than 70 hectares, the monastery of St. Jean-du-Chesne, and a house in Arcis. Danton has also taken good care of his <a name="2" class="hidden">family</a> – his mother receives a lifelong allowance of 600 francs every year, and his young wife benefitted from a wedding gift of 40,000 francs. Furthermore, the list of his expenses is even more impressive. Neither the allowance of a member of the Convention, nor the ministerial salary that he received for two months, nor the remuneration associated with any of his previous official functions would have been sufficient to make such purchases possible. This leads us directly to an accusation of corruption, although it may also be linked to one of the other reasons he is here today.
$FAB_017_DOC_01_02
As a minister of justice for a short time, he had the opportunity to make withdrawals from <a name="4" class="hidden">a secret fund</a> for expenses, the details of which cannot be openly disclosed. Bertrand de Molleville suggested in his memoirs that Danton, with the assistance of a person named <a name="5" class="hidden">Durand</a>, allegedly embezzled 100,000 francs from this very fund. The witness saw <a name="6" class="hidden">a note</a> confirming payment of such an amount to Danton by that middleman. Unfortunately, we are unable to question de Molleville in person as he disappeared soon before the trial of Citizen Capet.
$FAB_017_DOC_01_03
The third indictment has been submitted by Citizen Robespierre, who accuses Danton of being <a name="7" class="hidden">an English spy</a>. His task was to destabilise the everyday life of ordinary Parisians by continuously <a name="8" class="hidden">adding fuel to civil fury</a>, which allegedly led to bloodshed and social divisions. This scenario was once discovered by Marquis La Fayette before the end of Citizen Capet’s rule. At the time, such bloody internal conflict was supposed to prove that it would not be possible for the court and the people to reach an agreement, and that Louis had to use force to restore control of the situation. In practice, this would have put an end to the Revolution at the very last moment. These revelations have been confirmed to Robespierre by an agent from the Committee of General Security, Louis Comte, who tracked down the remains of the Girondin party. The same information was provided by two unrelated sources, revealing that Danton allegedly led a group of people who wanted to take over power in France and provide <a name="9" class="hidden">a place on the throne</a> for the Duke of York, the son of the English king.

Please introduce yourself.
$FAB_017_OnStart_01
I have roared so many times from the podium on behalf of the people that everybody here already knows me well enough!
$FAB_017_OnStart_02
Citizen Danton!
$FAB_017_OnStart_03
Thank you, Prosecutor Tinville, for providing that information in case anybody had forgotten.
$FAB_017_OnStart_04
You have been accused of a number of crimes, including corruption, embezzlement of public money, and treason.
$FAB_017_OnStart_05
Where are the cowards who accused me? Let me see them so I may cover them with shame!
$FAB_017_OnStart_06
You have been accused by the nation.
$FAB_017_OnStart_07
Really? And I thought it was that ferocious beast Robespierre, thirsty for fresh meat. But he will break his teeth on me!
$FAB_017_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Citizen Danton to be guillotined! Take him out immediately!
$FAB_017_OnGuilty_01
Is that how you treat your allies? You were supposed to free me, you traitor!
$FAB_017_OnGuilty_02
Get that bellowing boor out of here!
$FAB_017_OnGuilty_03
Let him rot!
$FAB_017_OnNotGuilty_00
I order you to let Citizen Danton go. He is innocent.
$FAB_017_OnNotGuilty_01
At least you know the meaning of the word “loyalty”.
$FAB_017_OnNotGuilty_02
Robespierre is not going to like this…
$FAB_017_OnNotGuilty_03
How can you release a traitor? How?!
$FAB_017_01x02_00_QTitle
Did your family know about the possible origin of the money you gave them?
$FAB_017_01x02_00_00
Did your family know about the possible origin of the money you gave them?
$FAB_017_01x02_00_01
Naturally. The money comes from my hard work on behalf of the people. Indeed, it is that work I am preoccupied with even now by thwarting the murderous attempts of that tyrant Robespierre!
$FAB_017_01x02_00_02
Do you intend to keep giving speeches throughout this trial instead of–
$FAB_017_01x02_00_03
Do not interrupt the man who sacrificed his health for the republic! I shared my last francs between my mother and wife instead of eating adequate food – or enjoying myself in drinking dens!
$FAB_017_01x02_00_04
And the estates you bought were also for your family?
$FAB_017_01x02_00_05
I took care of the future of my family, but it was from my own money. Only an unscrupulous bastard could say that a patriot such as myself could appropriate anything that belongs to my beloved country!
$FAB_017_01x03_01_QTitle
Where did you get the money for the extensive investments in property?
$FAB_017_01x03_01_00
Where did you get the money for the extensive investments in property?
$FAB_017_01x03_01_01
I worked for it. I kept the money for a long time, but only recently decided to invest it.
$FAB_017_01x03_01_02
You took advantage of the chaos and your position?
$FAB_017_01x03_01_03
I bought several properties that were falling into decline, ones that nobody wanted to take care of…
$FAB_017_01x03_01_04
It has been rumoured in the streets for some time now that Danton is corrupt. You could surely have taken advantage of your ministerial post.
$FAB_017_01x03_01_05
People of my stature and moral standing have no price as they cannot be bought!
$FAB_017_01x03_01_06
Then I shall ask you straight – did you take advantage of your ministerial post to purchase those properties?
$FAB_017_01x03_01_07
I was a minister for a mere two months, and if nothing else, that fact makes the accusation sound absurd.
$FAB_017_01x04_02_QTitle
Do you confirm the existence of a secret fund…
$FAB_017_01x04_02_00
Do you confirm the existence of a secret fund that you had at your disposal as the minister of justice?
$FAB_017_01x04_02_01
Yes, like every other minister before and after me.
$FAB_017_01x04_02_02
You have been accused of embezzling money fro–
$FAB_017_01x04_02_03
How many times have I been accused of corruption? Such aspersions have been cast on me since the beginning of my Revolutionary activity. But there has never been any evidence!
$FAB_017_01x04_02_04
Then how did you spend the money of that fund? Supposedly, it was as much as 400,000 francs.
$FAB_017_01x04_02_05
It is a secret fund. By disclosing any information on the matter, I could expose France to the threat of further ridicule and danger.
$FAB_017_01x04_02_06
You are saying that transparency will lead to our nation becoming a laughing-stock?
$FAB_017_01x04_02_07
Do not twist my words! I spent 200,000, and Fabre, my secretary, was also in a position to manage the remaining sum.
$FAB_017_01x04_02_08
But the amount returned was only 130,000. Where is the rest of the money?!
$FAB_017_01x04_02_09
It was spent in the best interest of France, which will never be understood by such ignoramuses as those who have accused me.
$FAB_017_01x06_03_QTitle
Where did Durand get the stated amount of 100,000 francs?
$FAB_017_01x06_03_00
Where did Durand get the stated amount of 100,000 francs?
$FAB_017_01x06_03_01
I do not know the man.
$FAB_017_01x06_03_02
His name has been associated with many corruption scandals. Is he a banker?
$FAB_017_01x06_03_03
All bankers are thieving bastards!
$FAB_017_01x06_03_04
Do not make me throw you from this room!
$FAB_017_01x06_03_05
As I have said – I do not know the man. I have heard the name, but that is all.
$FAB_017_01x06_03_06
So when we find him, he will confirm that you do not know each other?
$FAB_017_01x06_03_07
You will not find him. If his name has appeared in association with various corruption scandals and nobody has caught him thus far, it is only possible that–
$FAB_017_01x06_03_08
You had better be careful not to make hasty accusations.
$FAB_017_01x06_03_09
You either do not wish to find him or he does not exist at all. Or, perhaps this man’s name is not even Durand? Maybe every time you would like to accuse someone of corruption without evidence, you invoke the name Durand–
$FAB_017_01x06_03_10
Not so fast!
$FAB_017_01x06_03_11
This man may even be rotting in his grave, but whenever there is a need, whenever you require it, he nevertheless returns and continues to corrupt those you desire to behead!
$FAB_017_01x06_03_12
What a rogue!
$FAB_017_04x06_04_QTitle
Call in the witness.
$FAB_017_04x06_04_00
Call in the witness.
$FAB_017_04x06_04_02
Please introduce yourself.
$FAB_017_04x06_04_03
Philippe Le Bas.
$FAB_017_04x06_04_04
Robespierre’s faithful dog.
$FAB_017_04x06_04_05
Be quiet in my courtroom!
$FAB_017_03x07_05_QTitle
When did you begin to spy for our enemies?
$FAB_017_03x07_05_00
When did you begin to spy for our enemies?
$FAB_017_03x07_05_01
I have heard this accusation many times before, yet nobody has presented any–
$FAB_017_03x07_05_02
This time, however, someone has confirmed the gossip.
$FAB_017_03x07_05_03
A minor cheat is to be an authority here?
$FAB_017_03x07_05_04
Louis Comte is not a cheat.
$FAB_017_03x07_05_05
Then where is he now? Why is he not testifying?
$FAB_017_03x07_05_06
He was found strangled several days ago, in the room he rented for his stay in Paris.
$FAB_017_03x07_05_07
How typical. An unknown man makes an accusation and then disappears to avoid confrontation in the court!
$FAB_017_03x07_05_08
He did not disappear, he was murdered.
$FAB_017_03x07_05_09
That is even more unfortunate, as I now cannot prove he is a liar! Dear jurors, do not believe in this slander!
$FAB_017_07x09_06_QTitle
Did you personally meet the Duke of York?
$FAB_017_07x09_06_00
Did you personally meet the Duke of York?
$FAB_017_07x09_06_01
That is another piece of nonsense, made up–
$FAB_017_07x09_06_02
Answer me first, and maybe then I will allow you to give a speech.
$FAB_017_07x09_06_03
I never met the Duke of York, I never had any intention of meeting him, and I sincerely doubt that he had the intention of meeting with me, either.
$FAB_017_07x09_06_04
However, it has been confirmed by–
$FAB_017_07x09_06_05
Sources that you know nothing about because Comte never revealed them. Which is just as well, since enemy sources could spread such gossip to make us all destroy one another.
$FAB_017_08x07_07_QTitle
Robespierre claims that your recent actions have constituted treason on behalf of England.
$FAB_017_08x07_07_00
Robespierre claims that your recent actions have constituted treason on behalf of England.
$FAB_017_08x07_07_01
And how did he come to that conclusion?
$FAB_017_08x07_07_02
Citizen Robespierre says that–
$FAB_017_08x07_07_03
Citizen Robespierre says this, Citizen Robespierre says that… Am I being tried by France or by Robespierre? Are you so afraid, Prosecutor Tinville, that you must use Robespierre as an excuse?
$FAB_017_08x07_07_04
The evidence has been provided by France.
$FAB_017_08x07_07_05
You will cry for me when Robespierre’s shady affairs come to light, when he brings his army out against you! You will long for freedom, but then realise too late that you have already beheaded it!
$FAB_017_08x07_07_06
But it was you shouting in the streets, crying for the nation’s traitors to be sent to the guillotine!
$FAB_017_08x07_07_07
So send them, but not me!
$FAB_017_08x07_07_08
Are not such public speeches considered incitement of the crowd?
$FAB_017_08x07_07_09
If that were the case, everyone involved with the Revolution should be sent to the guillotine, as it was only possible because the crowd was willing to be incited!
$FAB_017_08x07_07_10
We do not need anything more…
$FAB_017_WIT_00_A_QTitle
Are you familiar with the memoirs of Bertrand de Molleville?
$FAB_017_WIT_00_A_00
Are you familiar with the memoirs of Bertrand de Molleville?
$FAB_017_WIT_00_A_01
Of course, after all I was one of the people who wanted to requisition the goods of this traitor.
$FAB_017_WIT_00_A_02
What do you know of the note issued by Durand?
$FAB_017_WIT_00_A_03
I only know as much as others have said – that it exists. Brissot has told me about it, for instance.
$FAB_017_WIT_00_A_04
That is all? Then why did you come forward as a witness?
$FAB_017_WIT_00_A_05
I simply wanted to help, and confirm that I have heard this gossip too.
$FAB_017_WIT_00_A_06
This is barely even a parody of a trial!
$FAB_017_WIT_00_B_QTitle
Do you know anything about Danton’s cooperation with the man known as Durand?
$FAB_017_WIT_00_B_00
Do you know anything about Danton’s cooperation with the man known as Durand?
$FAB_017_WIT_00_B_01
After former minister de Lessart was arrested, we were able to get some information from him.
$FAB_017_WIT_00_B_02
A typical minion of Robespierre!
$FAB_017_WIT_00_B_03
Shut up before I punch you, loudmouth!
$FAB_017_WIT_00_B_04
This included de Molleville’s conversation with de Lessart. The latter admitted that he had once given 24,000 francs to an unknown person with instructions to deliver it to Danton.
$FAB_017_WIT_00_B_05
Why would he do that?
$FAB_017_WIT_00_B_06
It was about supporting one of de Lessart’s projects.
$FAB_017_WIT_00_B_07
Could Durand have been this mysterious person?
$FAB_017_WIT_00_B_08
Well, since his name has been coming up everywhere, it probably was him.

How much was the wedding gift Danton gave his wife?
$FAB_017_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_00_00
40,000 francs.
$FAB_017_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_00_00
30,000 francs.
$FAB_017_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_00_01
50,000 francs.
$FAB_017_UNIQUE_QUESTION_01
According to the defendant, how much money from the secret ministry fund was taken by him?
$FAB_017_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_01_00
200,000 francs.
$FAB_017_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_00
He denied that such a fund exists.
$FAB_017_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_01
340,000 francs.
$FAB_017_UNIQUE_QUESTION_03
How did the defendant explain his acquaintance with the Duke of York?
$FAB_017_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_03_00
He said they had never met.
$FAB_017_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_03_00
He believes that his acquaintances are a private matter.
$FAB_017_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_03_01
He wanted to persuade the Duke to sympathise with the Revolution.
