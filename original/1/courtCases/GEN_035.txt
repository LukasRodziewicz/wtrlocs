Before the court stands Fabrice Cerdan, accused of <a name="1" class="hidden">inciting a riot</a> at <a name="2" class="hidden">the market on rue Cler</a>. The defendant is an 18-year-old tailor’s apprentice who has been working for Morel Gareau, the former personal tailor of Baroness de Ronsard. Due to the situation that arose as a result of the defendant’s actions, Sergeant Charles Le Vau, <a name="3" class="hidden">a member of the National Guard</a>, was beaten. Cerdan himself took part in the riot. He was caught red-handed, and, peculiarly, was <a name="4" class="hidden">dressed as a woman</a>.
$GEN_035_DOC_01_01
The most incriminating testimony came from Sylvie Martin, <a name="5" class="hidden">a greengrocer</a>. She had to be forcefully removed from the battered Sergeant Le Vau, as did other rioters, who to our surprise were mostly women.
$GEN_035_DOC_01_02
Martin testified that the tailor’s apprentice was wandering between the stands, shouting in a dramatic manner that Sergeant Le Vau <a name="6" class="hidden">tried to rape him</a>, and that his superiors had refused to carry out justice for the crime. 
$GEN_035_DOC_01_03
In a gesture of solidarity, Sylvie Martin and the other women present at the market attacked Sergeant Le Vau, who was carrying out a foot patrol nearby. The soldiers were so surprised by this female assault that they were soon disarmed and beaten. It is said that Cerdan also took an active part in the maltreatment of the Guard. To be precise, he was seen to kick him in the crotch. It may sound like a trivial matter, but the victim suffered severe injuries.
$GEN_035_DOC_01_04
The National Guard, along with a number of deputies, demand capital punishment for the person responsible for inciting the riot.
$GEN_035_OnStart_00
Pervert! Running around in women’s clothing!
$GEN_035_OnStart_01
I must admit that we do not see such individuals here often. Please introduce yourself.
$GEN_035_OnStart_02
Well… I’m Cerdan. Fabrice Cerdan, monsieur le juge.
$GEN_035_OnStart_03
Are you certain?
$GEN_035_OnStart_04
Yes, Fabrice. Fabrice, an absolutely normal guy. Tailor’s apprentice, I mean. That dress was… only a joke.
$GEN_035_OnStart_05
The defendant is accused of rousing a mob to attack a warrant officer of the National Guard, and then taking part in that assault. Does he consider that a joke too?
$GEN_035_OnStart_06
As a prosecutor, I demand the highest possible punishment for assaulting a soldier of the Republic.
$GEN_035_OnStart_07
Assault? I didn’t assault anybody, I swear!
$GEN_035_OnStart_08
Then who was running through the market yelling that Sergeant Le Vau is a rapist?
$GEN_035_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Citizen Fabrice Cerdan to be guillotined! Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_035_OnGuilty_01
Bravo!
$GEN_035_OnGuilty_02
Let his head roll!
$GEN_035_OnPrison_00
I sentence Citizen Fabrice Cerdan to prison! Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_035_OnPrison_01
Can’t you behead him?
$GEN_035_OnPrison_02
I wonder what kind of “jokes” that fellow will make once he gets out of prison?
$GEN_035_OnNotGuilty_00
The verdict in the case of Fabrice Cerdan is… not guilty! The defendant is free to go.
$GEN_035_OnNotGuilty_01
Unacceptable!
$GEN_035_OnNotGuilty_02
And Sylvie is still detained!
$GEN_035_OnNotGuilty_03
Is there no justice?!
$GEN_035_OnNotGuilty_04
I object! Letting the defendant get away with assaulting a French soldier is a crime.
$GEN_035_02x04_00_QTitle
Why was the defendant walking through the market on rue Cler in a dress?
$GEN_035_02x04_00_00
Why was the defendant walking through the market on rue Cler in a dress?
$GEN_035_02x04_00_01
I felt like eating onion soup, so I went shopping.
$GEN_035_02x04_00_02
Clown!
$GEN_035_02x04_00_03
But why in a dress?
$GEN_035_02x04_00_04
It was a disguise! Those old merchants, let them die of leprosy, won’t sell me anything otherwise.
$GEN_035_02x04_00_05
Could you explain?
$GEN_035_02x04_00_06
That fat cow Sylvie Martin tore her dress apart and then smeared us along the whole rue Cler, saying it was our fault. They spoiled our business, Martin and all those stupid market-hags who believed her.
$GEN_035_02x04_00_07
Don't you dare insult Sylvie, you fumbling excuse for a tailor!
$GEN_035_02x04_00_08
I see. But why would they not serve you?
$GEN_035_02x04_00_09
Because we started peddling the idea that eating their vegetables would cause hair to grow between your toes. I thought it was hilarious, but they didn’t agree.
$GEN_035_01x06_01_QTitle
Was there any reason why the defendant would want to incite the crowd against the Sergeant?
$GEN_035_01x06_01_00
Was there any reason why the defendant would want to incite the crowd against the Sergeant? Revenge perhaps?
$GEN_035_01x06_01_01
No way! He was our client, for Heaven’s sake! We made him his uniform, the same one he’s sitting in right now, as comfortable as if he was the Holy Roman emperor himself!
$GEN_035_01x06_01_02
Witnesses claimed that you kicked him in one of the more vulnerable parts of his body.
$GEN_035_01x06_01_03
I never kicked that twerp!
$GEN_035_01x06_01_04
Monsieur le juge, objection! The defendant should not use such epithets when talking about a warrant officer of the National Guard!
$GEN_035_01x06_01_05
Shut his mouth with a bat!
$GEN_035_01x06_01_06
The defendant needs to mind his words. So there is a conflict between the defendant and the victim?
$GEN_035_01x06_01_07
A conflict? That prick’s never paid my master for his uniform! Hey, Le Vau, since you’re here, hand me the 300 francs, will you? It’ll spare you a walk in the near future.
$GEN_035_01x06_01_08
That’s slander, monsieur le juge!
$GEN_035_01x06_01_09
Slander, my arse! Are you wearing a uniform or not? And who’s going to pay for it? Nobody! I’m actually glad those ladies messed your pretty face up.
$GEN_035_01x06_01_10
You are currently the one on trial, Citizen Cerdan, so spare us any further presentations.
$GEN_035_03x05_02_QTitle
Did Sergeant Le Vau really rape the defendant?
$GEN_035_03x05_02_00
Did Sergeant Le Vau really rape the defendant?
$GEN_035_03x05_02_01
What?! That’s absurd. I was just wearing the dress for laughs. I prefer the ladies!
$GEN_035_03x05_02_02
Nothing but lies! The witnesses heard you describe it in detail!
$GEN_035_03x05_02_03
Indeed, there were several testimonies that the defendant was talking about rape on rue Cler.
$GEN_035_03x05_02_04
He was probably just wishing for it.
$GEN_035_03x05_02_05
What do you expect from a strange peasant boy in a dress…
$GEN_035_03x05_02_06
Whatever happened to real men?
$GEN_035_03x05_02_07
I didn’t yell anything – it was that fat cow, Martin. She made it all up to take vengeance on Le Vau by using the other merchants. The whole market knows that she’s smitten with him, but he turned her down.
$GEN_035_03x05_02_08
He is lying again. The other testimonies tell a completely different story.
$GEN_035_03x05_02_09
You’re the fat cow!
$GEN_035_03x05_02_10
Silence! Does the victim wish to comment upon this?
$GEN_035_03x05_02_11
I have a fiancée, monsieur le juge. I do not recall any advances made by Citizen Martin, and to be honest I don’t know a thing about her romantic life.
$GEN_035_03x05_02_12
Does the victim know Sylvie Martin?
$GEN_035_03x05_02_13
I know all the stall-holders. She sometimes sells me vegetables for soup.
$GEN_035_01x05_03_QTitle
Call in the witness, Sylvie Martin.
$GEN_035_01x05_03_00
Call in the witness, Sylvie Martin.
$GEN_035_01x05_03_02
Please introduce yourself.
$GEN_035_01x05_03_03
Sylvie Martin.
$GEN_035_01x05_03_04
I would like to remind the witness that her involvement in this case is not connected to her being accused of assaulting Sergeant Le Vau.
$GEN_035_01x05_03_05
The testimony you are about to give shall be the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
$GEN_035_01x05_03_06
I know, I just want this swindler, this provocateur, this… this filthy lady-like louse to receive a fair punishment! It’s all his fault!
$GEN_035_02x05_04_QTitle
I believe the accused knows the Guard’s patrol schedule well?
$GEN_035_02x05_04_00
I believe the accused knows the Guard’s patrol schedule well?
$GEN_035_02x05_04_01
Who from rue Cler doesn’t? Everyone knows they start their rounds fifteen minutes late every day.
$GEN_035_02x05_04_02
Accusing the victim will not help you.
$GEN_035_02x05_04_03
Why don’t you tell us how Sergeant Le Vau grabbed your arse?
$GEN_035_02x05_04_04
Answer the question.
$GEN_035_02x05_04_05
They come late, scoff their breakfast, and then walk the same route the whole day. They don’t even bother to look in the alleys. God forbid there was something to do in them.
$GEN_035_02x05_04_06
So the accused was able to predict when Sergeant Le Vau would be near the market?
$GEN_035_02x05_04_07
I surely could’ve if I’d put my head to it, but I didn’t.
$GEN_035_02x05_04_08
He’s laughing in the Judge’s face! Put him over your knee and give him a hiding!
$GEN_035_02x05_04_09
Is that not a fascinating coincidence? The accused shows up on rue Cler dressed as a woman a few minutes before the Sergeant, and immediately a riot breaks out and Le Vau is their victim…
$GEN_035_02x05_04_10
Listen, I know how it looks, but coincidences always appear strange, right?
$GEN_035_02x05_04_11
The judge isn’t some dolt that’ll fall for your rubbish.
$GEN_035_03x06_05_QTitle
Did the defendant take part in the assault on Sergeant Le Vau?
$GEN_035_03x06_05_00
Did the defendant take part in the assault on Sergeant Le Vau?
$GEN_035_03x06_05_01
No. Then again, what kind of an attack was it anyway?
$GEN_035_03x06_05_02
The witnesses claim that the accused kicked the Sergeant in a very delicate part of the body. The same body part with which the Sergeant is to have supposedly… raped you.
$GEN_035_03x06_05_03
Bollocks. I was standing nearby and having a laugh, but I didn’t kick him myself. Even if I wanted to, there was no chance to get to him. The crones were all over him!
$GEN_035_03x06_05_04
Look at him, he's laughing.
$GEN_035_01x04_06_QTitle
Was the dress, which the accused is still wearing, supposed to help…?
$GEN_035_01x04_06_00
Was the dress, which the accused is still wearing, supposed to help him incite the riot?
$GEN_035_01x04_06_01
I really didn’t care for any rioting. I just wanted to make fun of Martin and her friends. I was just messing around.
$GEN_035_01x04_06_02
Because of your, allow me to quote the accused, "messing around", a human being has suffered.
$GEN_035_01x04_06_03
How am I to blame for them battering a dishonest soldier?
$GEN_035_01x03_07_QTitle
Does the defendant have any issues with the National Guard?
$GEN_035_01x03_07_00
Does the defendant have any issues with the National Guard?
$GEN_035_01x03_07_01
Of course he does, given what he did.
$GEN_035_01x03_07_02
No. Those boys are courageously defending the achievements of the Revolution. Keep up the good work!
$GEN_035_01x03_07_03
He’s sneering again!
$GEN_035_01x03_07_04
Somehow this has not prevented the defendant from creating an uproar against one of their Guards.
$GEN_035_01x03_07_05
He cannot hide the mirth in his eyes!
$GEN_035_01x03_07_06
I can see that.
$GEN_035_01x03_07_07
I didn’t create any uproar. I went shopping in a dress, and that’s all I admit to doing. I’m ready to pay a fine for that crime.
$GEN_035_WIT_00_A_QTitle
How did the witness meet the accused, Cerdan?
$GEN_035_WIT_00_A_00
How did the witness meet the accused, Cerdan?
$GEN_035_WIT_00_A_01
He sewed a dress for me, together with that blind scab Morel. I paid 30 francs for it, and the next day the dress comes apart at the seams! I’ve never been so embarrassed…
$GEN_035_WIT_00_A_02
Do I understand that the witness is not on friendly terms with either the defendant or his master?
$GEN_035_WIT_00_A_03
The witness seems to be claiming that they are swindlers.
$GEN_035_WIT_00_A_04
I am indeed. A plague on such tailors! I’ve warned all my friends about their business, and I hope they’ll soon pack it in, the talentless charlatans.
$GEN_035_WIT_00_A_05
My master told you, you stupid co… woman, that we had to sew it in a bigger size or the stitches wouldn’t hold. But no, you knew better… Try eating less and your clothes won’t split!
$GEN_035_WIT_01_A_QTitle
When did the witness recognise the defendant?
$GEN_035_WIT_01_A_00
When did the witness recognise the defendant?
$GEN_035_WIT_01_A_01
I knew who that flea-bitten lackey was the moment the Guards knocked his wig off!
$GEN_035_WIT_01_A_02
This only proves how carefully the defendant had disguised himself. He must have been preparing for this crime for some time.
$GEN_035_WIT_01_A_03
Guilty? They said he’s guilty!
$GEN_035_WIT_01_A_04
Did the witness not notice anything strange about this pretend-woman before that?
$GEN_035_WIT_01_A_05
Look, sir, how young he is, and no sign of a moustache. He wore a dress, a wig, rouge… How could I recognise him?
$GEN_035_WIT_01_B_QTitle
Why would the witness believe the defendant’s accusations…?
$GEN_035_WIT_01_B_00
Why would the witness believe the defendant’s accusations regarding the behaviour of Sergeant Le Vau?
$GEN_035_WIT_01_B_01
Well, sir… I know very well about Sergeant Le Vau’s wandering hands. People talk, you know? So, as a sensitive person, I joined the other women shouting at him, and the moment he showed his face–
$GEN_035_WIT_01_B_02
Objection! She’s making it up!
$GEN_035_WIT_01_B_03
Does the witness have any evidence of the soldier’s misdemeanour?
$GEN_035_WIT_01_B_04
Evidence… Well, I can tell you what he promised me when we were sitting on a bench in the park!
$GEN_035_WIT_01_B_05
Everybody, settle down! And I do not recall giving you permission to speak freely, Sergeant Le Vau!
