Remind me next time that I want to stop drinking this cloudy rotgut. Remind me BEFORE I drink it. We’re disgracing Themis, hah… Is someone coming?
$PROLOG_PRE_02_WF
This was bound to happen…
$PROLOG_PRE_03_ES
I told you…
$PROLOG_PRE_04_YS
Papa, you said we would go… You promised…
$PROLOG_PRE_05_MT
Papa had a lot of… work.
$PROLOG_PRE_06_ES
Yes, a lot of heavy glasses…
$PROLOG_PRE_07_WF
You promised me… I can’t anymore… I’m fed up with asking.
$PROLOG_PRE_08_YS
Mama is angry, because…
$PROLOG_PRE_09_ES
Quiet.
$PROLOG_PRE_10_WF
Today your favourite son wanted to prove he was more honourable than his father, so he started a fight. A five-year-old boy, for God’s sake!
$PROLOG_PRE_11_WF
Our neighbours wanted you to explain that to them, but… well, you were fighting for justice. At an inn. Damn you, you bloody drunk…
$PROLOG_PRE_12_ES
Mother…

Letter from Aurélie Dupond

To Judge Alexis Fidèle,

$PROLOG_CASE_DOC_MAIN
To Judge Alexis Fidèle,

	 we have not expected this kind of behaviour from your son, although, apparently, we should have. <a name="1" class="hidden">Innocent</a> child's play turned into <a name="2" class="hidden">an assault</a> on our children. 
	
	 The younger one, <a name="3" class="hidden">Antoine</a>, now has a chipped <a name="4" class="hidden">front tooth</a>. We hope that you will punish your child accordingly! Should the situation repeat itself, we will react more decisively. I am sure we can deal with a gambler and drunkard, even if he is a judge… We will not let our children be hurt!

How did your play turn into a fight?
$PROLOG_01_D1_02_YS
Our neighbours, Antoine and Jean… They were saying mean things about you. We were playing Guards and they asked me to pretend to be a drunkard whom they would… you know…
$PROLOG_01_D1_03_JD
You were fighting both of them at once?
$PROLOG_01_D1_04_YS
I had to.
$PROLOG_02_D1_01_JD
What exactly were they saying?
$PROLOG_02_D1_02_ES
Are you too drunk to guess?
$PROLOG_02_D1_03_JD
I was not asking you.
$PROLOG_02_D1_04_YS
They were yelling that you are… well… I told them, that it’s not true, and they started calling me names. They called me “a drunkard’s son”.
$PROLOG_03_D1_01_JD
Who started the fight?
$PROLOG_03_D1_02_ES
I can tell you who ended it…
$PROLOG_03_D1_03_YS
Uhm, I think it was… me. I kicked the one on the left, and then wanted to get the one on the right, but…
$PROLOG_03_D1_04_ES
But they ended it.
$PROLOG_03_D1_05_YS
They knocked me to the ground and paid me back for hitting them.
$PROLOG_04_D1_01_JD
Did you really break Antoine’s tooth?
$PROLOG_04_D1_02_ES
Frédéric is just a child.
$PROLOG_04_D1_03_YS
I don’t know… I don’t think so.
$PROLOG_04_D1_04_JD
Did you hit him in the face?
$PROLOG_04_D1_05_YS
I think I kicked him, but not that hard…
$PROLOG_CASE_ON_GUILTY
Unfortunately you should not start fights, regardless of the reason.
$PROLOG_CASE_ON_NOTGUILTY
You did well. A man has to defend the honour of his family, no matter what.
$PROLOG_POST_01_WF
Those children are so small, and they already know the truth – the father of my children is a lying drunk and a gambler. Bernard used to worship you, but he soon grew up. Now it is Frédéric’s turn to learn the truth that echoes in the streets.
$PROLOG_POST_02_WF
And you, Raymond? You’re supposed to be my husband’s mentor – is this what you wanted to teach him? How to repeat your mistakes and lose his family?
$PROLOG_POST_03_MT
I was unaware that Mathilde had such a temper.
$PROLOG_POST_04_JD
As was I…
$PROLOG_POST_05_WF
We will wait outside, as always.
$PROLOG_GUILTY
Guilty
