In the dock is Laurent Pascal, arrested for Counter-Revolutionary activity and the assault of a Gendarme that proved fatal. The accused owns a small <a name="1" class="hidden">weaving shop</a> that he lives alone behind on rue Popincourt in the 24th Section. That is where the crime took place.
$GEN_001_DOC_01_01
The incident that is the subject of this case happened yesterday evening. Having received a denunciation of Citizen Pascal’s <a name="3" class="hidden">Counter-Revolutionary activity</a> that was directed to the legally chosen authorities of Paris, two gendarmes, Cristobal Rémy and Fabrice Roux, arrived to <a name="4" class="hidden">bring him in</a> for questioning.
$GEN_001_DOC_01_02
It is said that Citizen Pascal started a heated discussion with the gendarmes and denied all accusations. He behaved raucously and crudely, threatening the gendarmes <a name="5" class="hidden">with violence</a>. When they attempted to arrest him, he began to struggle and a fight ensued, during which Citizen Pascal smashed Gendarme Roux’s head against a door frame. The impact was so strong that his skull cracked open. Gendarme Rémy then overpowered Pascal, and incapacitated him with a blow from the butt of his musket.
$GEN_001_DOC_01_03
<h1>Laurent Pascal</h1> In the course of the investigation, we asked the neighbours of the accused for their opinion of him. They described Pascal as an impulsive person, always ready to fight – at least since the death of his wife. The owner of a local inn revealed that in recent months Pascal has been a frequent guest, and was usually <a name="7" class="hidden">drinking</a> more than he should.
$GEN_001_DOC_01_04
<a name="2" class="hidden">The wife</a> of the accused was reportedly decapitated last spring. Unfortunately, there were no records in the archives to indicate what she was sentenced for.

Cristobal Rémy’s testimony
$GEN_001_DOC_02_00
Fabrice was my friend. Pascal cracked his head open even though Fabrice did nothing to him. We were to bring him in for questioning because they had some doubts about a testimony, which was <a name="8" class="hidden">withdrawn</a> by that degenerate Maxime after Fabrice’s death…
$GEN_001_DOC_03_HEADER
Maxime’s testimony
$GEN_001_DOC_03_00
Laurent Pascal is a meddling prick and an informer. That’s right, I’m denouncing the snoop. He’s putting up posters and running around with <a name="9" class="hidden">leaflets</a> that make fun of Citizen Robespierre. Of our God-fearing statesman! One of his leaflets shows Robespierre as a pervert and a vampire. I saw it the day before yesterday – a fat fellow dressed like Pascal. It must’ve been him. I bet he’s plotting in that little shop of his. He never lends a franc for a cup of wine, that snooping meddler. Those men always have something to hide, don’t they?
$GEN_001_OnStart_00
That man is a murderer, but we cannot be sure of anything else.
$GEN_001_OnStart_01
Please introduce yourself.
$GEN_001_OnStart_02
Laurent Pascal, weaver by trade.
$GEN_001_OnStart_03
You stand accused of murdering Gendarme Roux.
$GEN_001_OnStart_04
It was an accident.
$GEN_001_OnStart_05
Smashing his skull open was an accident?!
$GEN_001_OnStart_06
So you are not pleading guilty?
$GEN_001_OnStart_07
I’m saying it was an accident.
$GEN_001_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Citizen Laurent Pascal to be guillotined! Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_001_OnGuilty_01
An excellent decision. Now they will know not to raise a hand against the National Guard.
$GEN_001_OnGuilty_02
Those in power always cover for each other…
$GEN_001_OnPrison_00
I sentence Citizen Laurent Pascal to prison! Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_001_OnPrison_01
That verdict is definitely too lenient. Murder is murder.
$GEN_001_OnPrison_02
Those in power always cover for each other…
$GEN_001_OnNotGuilty_00
I acquit Citizen Pascal of all charges! You are free to go.
$GEN_001_OnNotGuilty_01
It’s a good thing there’s someone just in this court…
$GEN_001_OnNotGuilty_02
He admitted to the murder. Is that still not enough for you?
$GEN_001_01x02_00_QTitle
Do you tend to your shop by yourself?
$GEN_001_01x02_00_00
Do you tend to your shop by yourself?
$GEN_001_01x02_00_01
Yes. I opened it with my wife, but… Now I run it alone.
$GEN_001_01x02_00_02
Did you start your Counter-Revolutionary activity when she was alive? Was that the reason for her sentence?
$GEN_001_01x02_00_03
There was no reason to decapitate her.
$GEN_001_01x02_00_04
They can put you in jail for no reason, but not decapitation.
$GEN_001_01x03_01_QTitle
Are you conducting Counter-Revolutionary activity in your shop?
$GEN_001_01x03_01_00
Are you conducting Counter-Revolutionary activity in your shop?
$GEN_001_01x03_01_01
Of course not, that’s absurd.
$GEN_001_01x03_01_02
A denunciation from someone named Maxime suggests something to the contrary.
$GEN_001_01x03_01_03
But didn’t he take it back?
$GEN_001_01x03_01_04
Yes, but we do not know why.
$GEN_001_01x03_01_05
He was probably threatened by other plotters.
$GEN_001_01x03_01_06
People, listen, there was no plot.
$GEN_001_01x03_01_07
Were you hanging posters on the streets of Paris?
$GEN_001_01x03_01_08
The denunciation said he was.
$GEN_001_01x03_01_09
Go and look in my shop again, but you won't find any posters or leaflets there.
$GEN_001_02x07_02_QTitle
Apparently you have problems with alcohol.
$GEN_001_02x07_02_00
Apparently you have problems with alcohol.
$GEN_001_02x07_02_01
Do you have a wife?
$GEN_001_02x07_02_02
What does that have to do with anything?
$GEN_001_02x07_02_03
If you had to watch your wife get her head cut off for no reason, you’d have problems with alcohol as well.
$GEN_001_02x07_02_04
The Judge has problems with wine because his wife is still alive!
$GEN_001_02x07_02_05
Do you realise that the gendarme you killed was someone’s son and husband? Does your wife’s death excuse what you did?
$GEN_001_02x07_02_06
…
$GEN_001_02x07_02_07
Murderer!
$GEN_001_02x03_03_QTitle
What was your wife sentenced for?
$GEN_001_02x03_03_00
What was your wife sentenced for?
$GEN_001_02x03_03_01
To this day I don’t know for sure. They said subversive activity, whatever that means.
$GEN_001_02x03_03_02
What connections did she have?
$GEN_001_02x03_03_03
Were there any connections?
$GEN_001_02x03_03_04
Her grandfather was an equerry in the former King’s service. Someone informed on her, just like on me, and that was it…
$GEN_001_02x03_03_05
Did you receive instructions and Monarchist leaflets from your wife’s grandfather?
$GEN_001_02x03_03_06
He died 15 years ago!
$GEN_001_02x03_03_07
Were you present at your wife’s trial?
$GEN_001_02x03_03_08
I had to collect goods for the shop and wasn’t home for a few days. But that was enough for them to arrest and try her… They gave us… they gave us ten minutes to have our last conversation. Do you understand? Ten minutes to say goodbye to the woman you love? And the day after… they decapitated her in the square. The head of my beloved Marie… rolling in the dirt like a piece of rubbish…
$GEN_001_03x08_04_QTitle
Do you have any idea why Citizen Maxime withdrew his denunciation?
$GEN_001_03x08_04_00
Do you have any idea why Citizen Maxime withdrew his denunciation?
$GEN_001_03x08_04_01
How would I know? He probably did it when he’d sobered up.
$GEN_001_03x08_04_02
Citizen Maxime drinks a lot?
$GEN_001_03x08_04_03
He sure does. What, your investigators couldn’t find that out?
$GEN_001_03x08_04_04
Those idle blockheads.
$GEN_001_03x08_04_05
Maybe we should ask a different question. Tell me, why did he write it in the first place? He surely had good reason.
$GEN_001_03x08_04_06
Damned if I know… Though he did insult me once because I refused to buy him wine at the inn.
$GEN_001_03x09_05_QTitle
Do you have anything to do with these irreverent leaflets?
$GEN_001_03x09_05_00
Do you have anything to do with these irreverent leaflets?
$GEN_001_03x09_05_01
The only thing I know about politics is that it killed my Marie.
$GEN_001_03x09_05_02
Is that why you decided to become an enemy of the Republic?
$GEN_001_03x09_05_03
It does sound like a motive.
$GEN_001_03x09_05_04
He probably wanted vengeance for his wife. He should have kept her under control.
$GEN_001_03x09_05_05
Why would I? Will those leaflets bring my wife back?
$GEN_001_03x09_05_06
I would ask that the accused behave appropriately.
$GEN_001_03x09_05_07
Or what? Will you cut my head off for being rude?
$GEN_001_03x04_06_QTitle
Gendarmes Roux and Rémy paid you a visit…
$GEN_001_03x04_06_00
Gendarmes Roux and Rémy paid you a visit in order to bring you in for questioning, is that correct?
$GEN_001_03x04_06_01
Paid me a visit? Well, of course. They knocked on the door, we had some tea, and talked about the good old days. That’s exactly what happened. Come off it! They banged on the door like they wanted the entire neighbourhood to know what was going on, all the time bellowing about how they were coming to arrest me!
$GEN_001_03x04_06_02
What happened next?
$GEN_001_03x04_06_03
I let them in, of course. They immediately rushed in and pushed me around, trying to restrain me like I was some common thug!
$GEN_001_03x04_06_04
That’s how they treat people!
$GEN_001_03x04_06_05
If you had simply let them restrain you they would not have had to push you around. Resisting arrest does not paint you in a good light.
$GEN_001_03x04_06_06
Did the gendarmes show you the arrest warrant?
$GEN_001_03x04_06_07
As if they ever do that. They didn’t show it to my Marie, just came at night, armed, like thugs.
$GEN_001_04x05_07_QTitle
Was there a struggle that evening?
$GEN_001_04x05_07_00
Was there a struggle that evening?
$GEN_001_04x05_07_01
I refused to go. I knew I’d end up like my wife.
$GEN_001_04x05_07_02
We know their type! Every other one’s as thick as pig shit!
$GEN_001_04x05_07_03
But the gendarmes had the right to arrest you. You should not have resisted.
$GEN_001_04x05_07_04
I didn’t plan what happened. When I didn’t let them restrain me, one of them punched me in the face. Then… something in me snapped. I don’t remember it well, everything happened so fast.
$GEN_001_04x05_07_05
The whole situation would not have taken place if you had been less aggressive…
$GEN_001_04x05_07_06
How did Gendarme Roux die?
$GEN_001_04x05_07_07
…
$GEN_001_04x05_07_08
Citizen Pascal?
$GEN_001_04x05_07_09
We were struggling. My Marie probably struggled too… I pushed that gendarme, he tripped and his face hit something…
$GEN_001_04x05_07_10
The door frame.
$GEN_001_04x05_07_11
His eyes rolled up and he fell to the floor, shaking. There was blood, a lot of blood…
$GEN_001_04x05_07_12
Call in the witness, Cristobal Rémy.
$GEN_001_04x05_07_14
For the sake of protocol, please introduce yourself.
$GEN_001_04x05_07_15
Cristobal Rémy, soldier in the National Guard.
$GEN_001_04x07_08_QTitle
Were you drunk that evening?
$GEN_001_04x07_08_00
Were you drunk that evening?
$GEN_001_04x07_08_01
I drink something every evening.
$GEN_001_04x07_08_02
Speak clearly. Did you drink on that evening?
$GEN_001_04x07_08_03
Yes, monsieur le juge. I think I am allowed to drink wine in my own home?
$GEN_001_04x07_08_04
Are you always so aggressive after alcohol?
$GEN_001_04x07_08_05
I’ve never hurt anyone before.
$GEN_001_04x07_08_06
There’s a first time for everything.
$GEN_001_05x07_09_QTitle
People say you are prone to violence.
$GEN_001_05x07_09_00
People say you are prone to violence.
$GEN_001_05x07_09_01
Isn’t that the only option in this filthy city? I know what you’d like to call me – an animal, a beast that ran amok and killed senselessly. But do you know the real beast? Paris. This crazy, bloodthirsty creature.
$GEN_001_05x07_09_02
He’s delirious.
$GEN_001_05x07_09_03
Everyone has a choice. Thousands of Parisians decide to lead a life where they are neither executioners nor victims.
$GEN_001_05x07_09_04
As you like. I know what I know.
$GEN_001_05x08_10_QTitle
Did you have anything to do with Maxime withdrawing his denunciation?
$GEN_001_05x08_10_00
Did you have anything to do with Maxime withdrawing his denunciation?
$GEN_001_05x08_10_01
You know I was in a cell. What kind of stupid question is that?
$GEN_001_05x08_10_02
The Judge could at least look at the notes.
$GEN_001_05x08_10_03
You were participating in a Monarchist conspiracy. Who was helping you?
$GEN_001_05x08_10_04
Conspiracy? I was working like a horse. When was I supposed to have the time to conspire?
$GEN_001_WIT_00_A_QTitle
Could you describe what happened that evening?
$GEN_001_WIT_00_A_00
Could you describe what happened that evening?
$GEN_001_WIT_00_A_01
We went to the address written in the order and knocked on the door. It was supposed to be a routine procedure, we didn’t expect any difficulties.
$GEN_001_WIT_00_A_02
How loud were you?
$GEN_001_WIT_00_A_03
The knocking was loud, true. I shouted that we were gendarmes, but that’s not unusual. We always announce ourselves so they know they should open the door.
$GEN_001_WIT_01_A_QTitle
Did you attack Citizen Pascal?
$GEN_001_WIT_01_A_00
Did you attack Citizen Pascal?
$GEN_001_WIT_01_A_01
When we told him the reason for our visit he started shouting that he wouldn’t go with us.
$GEN_001_WIT_01_A_02
So you decided to use force?
$GEN_001_WIT_01_A_03
Fabrice tried to catch him and lead him out, as we always do.
$GEN_001_WIT_01_A_04
So you followed the rules.
$GEN_001_WIT_01_A_05
Of course.
$GEN_001_WIT_01_A_06
Right, because they never break them.
$GEN_001_WIT_01_A_07
Did you hit him in the head with your musket?
$GEN_001_WIT_01_A_08
Yes. Unfortunately, it was already too late.
$GEN_001_WIT_01_B_QTitle
What do you know about the wife of the accused?
$GEN_001_WIT_01_B_00
What do you know about the wife of the accused?
$GEN_001_WIT_01_B_01
I’m uncomfortable speaking about it…
$GEN_001_WIT_01_B_02
Let me make you more comfortable by reminding you that refusing to answer my questions could lead to your dismissal.
$GEN_001_WIT_01_B_03
Fabrice once told me that he tried to seduce a woman. He visited her when her husband was away, but she wasn’t interested. So he waited until she was alone again and paid her another visit, but she still refused him. Then he arrested her for assaulting an officer–
$GEN_001_WIT_01_B_04
Wait… He arrested her because she was not interested in him?
$GEN_001_WIT_01_B_05
That’s right. He thought she’d be scared of jail and have a change of heart. Unfortunately, she was tried by a judge who was quick to sentence people to the guillotine. I didn’t make the connection at first, but when I saw the look in the eyes of the defendant during the arrest… I realised what had happened.
$GEN_001_WIT_01_B_06
So Pascal took revenge on the bastard that killed his wife?
$GEN_001_WIT_01_B_08
Do you confirm this testimony?
$GEN_001_WIT_01_B_09
I can only confirm the words my wife told me from behind her prison bars.
$GEN_001_WIT_01_B_10
Speak without fear.
$GEN_001_WIT_01_B_11
I killed a man, unintentionally. The fact that it happened to be him… well, I’m glad. Yes, I can confirm what the witness has said…
