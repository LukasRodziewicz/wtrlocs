In the dock sits the wife of the convicted Citizen Louis Capet. Marie Antoinette, a 38-year-old Austrian who came to France at the age of 14 to wed the 16-year-old Louis. Their marriage was political – it was supposed to tighten the alliance between Austria and France.
$GEN_017_DOC_01_01
Both Marie Antoinette and her late husband lacked the experience and knowledge required to rule a country. Their incompetence resulted in France being left in debt, and the French in hunger and poverty. The former Queen and her husband were incapable of restraining themselves from their <a name="1" class="hidden">profligate lifestyle</a>, even when the price of bread became unapproachable for the common Citizen.
$GEN_017_DOC_01_02
Marie Antoinette and Louis Capet tried to <a name="2" class="hidden">escape</a> from the Tuileries Palace, where the Capets had been confined by the Revolutionaries. The two intended to return to France with neighbouring armies, but they were caught before they could cross the border.
$GEN_017_DOC_01_03
Louis and Marie Antoinette were able to avoid lynching upon their return due to <a name="3" class="hidden">Antoine Barnave’s</a> protection. The famous orator interceded on their behalf, which made him a suspect. It is thought that Marie Antoinette ensnared him so as to use him for her political agenda.
$GEN_017_DOC_01_04
For many years, Marie Antoinette has been accused of acting against France’s best interests, plunging the state’s budget into a deep deficit, plotting against the Revolution, and trying to <a name="5" class="hidden">rebuild the Monarchy</a>.
$GEN_017_DOC_01_05
The failures of France against Austria can be attributed to her treason. We suspect that she conveyed <a name="6" class="hidden">French military secrets</a> to her homeland, but we lack evidence to support this claim.
$GEN_017_DOC_01_06
The Citizen is also accused of <a name="7" class="hidden">promiscuity</a>. Moreover, there have been suggestions that she sexually harassed her eight-year-old son, <a name="8" class="hidden">Louis-Charles</a>.
$GEN_017_OnStart_00
Now you’ll pay!
$GEN_017_OnStart_01
Bear in mind that this is no common case. Your future depends on your sentence.
$GEN_017_OnStart_02
Please introduce yourself.
$GEN_017_OnStart_03
Excuse me?
$GEN_017_OnStart_04
I could interpret that question as contempt of court.
$GEN_017_OnStart_05
Maria Antonia Josepha Johanna von Österreich, also known as Marie Antoinette of Austria or Marie Antoinette. However, I would prefer to be called “the Queen”.
$GEN_017_OnStart_06
I will use the term “the accused”.
$GEN_017_OnStart_07
Why not “you Austrian whore”?
$GEN_017_OnGuilty_00
I sentence the accused Marie Antoinette of Austria to the guillotine.
$GEN_017_OnGuilty_01
The Ancien Régime should have been beheaded long ago.
$GEN_017_OnGuilty_02
Huzzah!
$GEN_017_OnGuilty_03
Justice is served at last!
$GEN_017_OnPrison_00
I sentence Marie Antoinette of Austria to prison. Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_017_OnPrison_01
That is far too lenient a sentence.
$GEN_017_OnPrison_02
Lucky you!
$GEN_017_OnPrison_03
The judge showed remorse?!
$GEN_017_OnPrison_04
Let her die in prison!
$GEN_017_OnNotGuilty_00
I find the defendant not guilty. She is free to leave.
$GEN_017_OnNotGuilty_01
Are you blind, man?
$GEN_017_OnNotGuilty_02
Is he crazy?
$GEN_017_OnNotGuilty_03
Letting her go is sentencing her to death!
$GEN_017_01x04_00_QTitle
Why did the accused live in luxury…?
$GEN_017_01x04_00_00
Why did the accused live in luxury despite the state’s treasury deficit?
$GEN_017_01x04_00_01
Take a look at the previous queen’s expenditures and the ones before her. Once you compare them, you will see I was using far less money than they were.
$GEN_017_01x04_00_02
We must also take into account the situation of the Citizens then and during the reign of the accused and her husband.
$GEN_017_01x04_00_03
Take into account my rotten potatoes!
$GEN_017_01x04_00_04
I do not recall the former queens being addicted to gambling.
$GEN_017_01x04_00_05
We all have our vices.
$GEN_017_01x08_01_QTitle
The accused has led a self-indulgent life, and whether Citizen Capet’s son is really the fruit of his loins has long been in question.
$GEN_017_01x08_01_00
The accused has led a self-indulgent life, and whether Citizen Capet’s son is really the fruit of his loins has long been in question. Will the accused respond to those allegations?
$GEN_017_01x08_01_01
I was always faithful to my husband. The rest is merely idle gossip.
$GEN_017_01x08_01_02
Is the accused afraid to discuss it?
$GEN_017_01x08_01_03
She could go on all night!
$GEN_017_01x08_01_04
There is nothing to discuss.
$GEN_017_01x08_01_05
Citizen Capet was supposed to have confirmed that “gossip”.
$GEN_017_01x08_01_06
He is dead, which makes that remark rather… inelegant. But I shall reply anyway. My husband trusted me, and I him. That is all.
$GEN_017_01x08_01_07
Everyone knows Citizen Capet was a fool.
$GEN_017_02x05_02_QTitle
What future did the defendant expect had her escape been successful?
$GEN_017_02x05_02_00
What future did the defendant expect had her escape been successful?
$GEN_017_02x05_02_01
Our plan was to survive. We believed that nothing good awaited us in this country. We were clearly not mistaken.
$GEN_017_02x05_02_02
So you understood that the people would seek revenge for their suffering.
$GEN_017_02x05_02_03
Many would cheer my death.
$GEN_017_02x05_02_04
We surely would!
$GEN_017_02x05_02_05
And we surely will!
$GEN_017_02x05_02_06
If it were not for the defendant’s escape, we would not be speaking today, and the people would not have lost what little trust remained. Everyone believed that it was a part of your plot.
$GEN_017_02x05_02_07
I wish to see at least one piece of evidence of our plot.
$GEN_017_02x05_02_08
We don’t need proof!
$GEN_017_02x03_03_QTitle
What was your relationship with Antoine Barnave?
$GEN_017_02x03_03_00
What was your relationship with Antoine Barnave?
$GEN_017_02x03_03_01
He was my friend. He helped us, and was one of the few people who treated us with respect when everyone else turned against us.
$GEN_017_02x03_03_02
Yeah, I wonder if she returned the favour under the sheets!
$GEN_017_02x03_03_03
Does the accused realise that by asking Citizen Barnave for help, she has also caused him serious problems?
$GEN_017_02x03_03_04
I neither made any promises, nor have I ever asked him for help. We were simply alike, and that may be the reason for our friendship.
$GEN_017_02x03_03_05
Were you sexually involved with him?
$GEN_017_02x03_03_06
Austrian bitch!
$GEN_017_02x03_03_07
Of course not.
$GEN_017_02x03_03_08
Then why would he take such a risk corresponding with you?
$GEN_017_02x03_03_09
I only hope that he receives a fair trial, followed by his acquittal.
$GEN_017_02x03_03_10
Behead him!
$GEN_017_07x08_04_QTitle
Does the accused see herself as an exemplary mother?
$GEN_017_07x08_04_00
Does the accused see herself as an exemplary mother?
$GEN_017_07x08_04_01
I cannot answer that, and I do not wish to… You should ask my son.
$GEN_017_07x08_04_02
Before we do that, I would like to ask the defendant about the accusations regarding the indecent molestation of Louis-Charles.
$GEN_017_07x08_04_03
No mother would dignify such atrocious accusations with a response.
$GEN_017_07x08_04_04
Summon the witness, the son of the accused, Louis-Charles.
$GEN_017_07x08_04_06
Please introduce yourself.
$GEN_017_07x08_04_07
My name is Louis-Charles.
$GEN_017_07x08_04_08
Do you know why we have invited you here?
$GEN_017_07x08_04_09
No. Why?
$GEN_017_03x08_05_QTitle
What was the relationship between Antoine Barnave and the son of the accused?
$GEN_017_03x08_05_00
What was the relationship between Antoine Barnave and the son of the accused?
$GEN_017_03x08_05_01
Antoine was a friend of the family. I believe that Charles liked him very much, and maybe even admired him.
$GEN_017_03x08_05_02
How did you treat him?
$GEN_017_03x08_05_03
As I would a friend. Is that so strange?
$GEN_017_03x08_05_04
We do not find it strange at all.
$GEN_017_02x08_06_QTitle
How did the young Louis-Charles endure the hardships of your escape?
$GEN_017_02x08_06_00
How did the young Louis-Charles endure the hardships of your escape?
$GEN_017_02x08_06_01
Not well. He has the misfortune of struggling with tuberculosis and the circumstances further aggravated the disease.
$GEN_017_02x08_06_02
When planning the escape, did you consider his health at all?
$GEN_017_02x08_06_03
I was thinking only of him. He could have been recovering in the hot springs today, instead of being tortured by the suffocating Paris air…
$GEN_017_02x08_06_04
The only water our children will ever see is the Seine.
$GEN_017_03x05_07_QTitle
I must admit that you and Antoine Barnave are much alike.
$GEN_017_03x05_07_00
I must admit that you and Antoine Barnave are much alike. Has the accused ever suspected that he helped you for his own profit?
$GEN_017_03x05_07_01
I never even considered such a thing. Antoine is a good person who wanted to help. I am not one to judge him for his political views.
$GEN_017_03x05_07_02
The most important thing you shared was your hatred of France.
$GEN_017_03x05_07_03
Nonsense, I…
$GEN_017_03x05_07_04
We had to survive on bones, while you were devouring meat!
$GEN_017_06x02_08_QTitle
Has the accused ever conveyed French military secrets to Austria?
$GEN_017_06x02_08_00
Has the accused ever conveyed French military secrets to Austria?
$GEN_017_06x02_08_01
What manner of secrets could I possibly know?
$GEN_017_06x02_08_02
Let us start with the strength and weaponry of the army.
$GEN_017_06x02_08_03
What an absurd accusation… I could not even tell a mortar from a musket.
$GEN_017_06x02_08_04
You do not have to know the difference to take notes and send them to other parties.
$GEN_017_06x02_08_05
I am the queen, not a spy.
$GEN_017_06x02_08_06
She denies it, the whore!
$GEN_017_WIT_00_A_QTitle
Did your mother ever do something to you that felt wrong?
$GEN_017_WIT_00_A_00
Did your mother ever do something to you that felt wrong?
$GEN_017_WIT_00_A_01
Such as?
$GEN_017_WIT_00_A_02
Things that would make you feel ashamed.
$GEN_017_WIT_00_A_03
Err, mother liked to hug me in front of everyone. It embarrassed me.
$GEN_017_WIT_00_A_04
Did she often hug you?
$GEN_017_WIT_00_A_05
Very often. Sometimes she would even come to my chamber at night just to hug me.
$GEN_017_WIT_00_A_06
Did you feel embarrassed then?
$GEN_017_WIT_00_A_07
No, because nobody was watching.
$GEN_017_WIT_01_A_QTitle
Did your mother mention to you the plan to escape to Austria and abolish the Republic?
$GEN_017_WIT_01_A_00
Did your mother mention to you the plan to escape to Austria and abolish the Republic?
$GEN_017_WIT_01_A_01
No, neither mother nor father would ever mention that.
$GEN_017_WIT_01_A_02
Was Mr Barnave a frequent guest?
$GEN_017_WIT_01_A_03
Yes! I like Mr Barnave very much. He’s always very nice and brings me toys. Recently he brought me this wooden guard…
$GEN_017_WIT_01_A_04
Were he and your mother doing anything you found strange?
$GEN_017_WIT_01_A_05
Mother once told me to respect him just like my father.
