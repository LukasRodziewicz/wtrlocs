In the dock is Lucien Blanchot, a resident of the Section des Gravilliers, rue Meslée. Citizen Blanchot owns several grocery stalls. We have received multiple <a name="1" class="hidden">complaints</a> regarding his unfair trading practices, such as selling spoiled fruit, price speculation, and the violation of <a name="3" class="hidden">legal price limits</a>. 
$GEN_003_DOC_01_01
Mr Blanchot has denied all the accusations, but my investigation at his stalls revealed at least some of the complaints to be justified. He claimed that the prices were inflated due to <a name="4" class="hidden">“employee mistakes”</a>, and that spoiled produce was about to be disposed of on the day of the inspection. It must be noted that when the inspectors pointed out his transgressions, Blanchot scolded his employees and readily set about restoring order at his stall.

<h1>Lucien Blanchot</h1>
A young merchant and staunch supporter of the Jacobins. He has <a name="5" class="hidden">connections</a> with Marat and Robespierre, or so he claims. So far he has managed to get away with all his shady dealings, so there may be some truth to his boasting. 
$GEN_003_DOC_01_03
Witness 1: “He sold me rotten apples. He put some fresh ones on top so that I wouldn’t notice!”
$GEN_003_DOC_01_04
Witness 2: “My husband <a name="7" class="hidden">couldn’t stop retching for two days</a> after eating celery he bought from this swindler!”
$GEN_003_OnStart_00
I bought carrots from him myself!
$GEN_003_OnStart_01
Please introduce yourself.
$GEN_003_OnStart_02
Lucien Blanchot.
$GEN_003_OnStart_03
Occupation?
$GEN_003_OnStart_04
Currently? Merchant. Also, temporarily a prisoner.
$GEN_003_OnStart_05
You stand accused of price speculation, breaking legal price limits, and selling produce unfit for consumption.
$GEN_003_OnStart_06
Is that all?
$GEN_003_OnStart_07
I ask the court to add deliberate poisoning of Parisian Citizens to the list of charges.
$GEN_003_OnStart_08
Poisoning? Stale vegetables never killed anyone.
$GEN_003_OnStart_09
So you admit to the other charges?
$GEN_003_OnStart_10
I am an honest entrepreneur, and my business will not be harmed by such allegations.
$GEN_003_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Citizen Lucien Blanchot to the guillotine! Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_003_OnGuilty_01
Unthinkable! A death sentence for a minor wrongdoing? I object!
$GEN_003_OnGuilty_02
Let’s see how fresh he stays now!
$GEN_003_OnGuilty_03
I have friends in high places! You'll regret this, you incompetent wretch!
$GEN_003_OnPrison_00
I sentence Citizen Lucien Blanchot to prison! Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_003_OnPrison_01
Let's see how fresh he stays behind bars!
$GEN_003_OnPrison_02
I have friends in high places. I will be set free in a matter of days. You, on the other hand…
$GEN_003_OnNotGuilty_00
The verdict in the case of Citizen Blanchot… Not guilty! The defendant is free to go.
$GEN_003_OnNotGuilty_01
Thank you for your just verdict. It warms my heart to know that we have such honourable judges.
$GEN_003_OnNotGuilty_02
It’s a mockery!
$GEN_003_OnNotGuilty_03
Not guilty? The evidence was served on a plate!
$GEN_003_01x06_00_QTitle
Do you admit to selling spoiled produce?
$GEN_003_01x06_00_00
Do you admit to selling spoiled produce?
$GEN_003_01x06_00_01
That has already been established by the inspectors. There is no need to go over the matter again.
$GEN_003_01x06_00_02
Answer the question!
$GEN_003_01x06_00_03
Yes and no. Yes, because I admit that such things have been reported at my stalls. No, because it was not my fault.
$GEN_003_01x06_00_04
Whose fault was it, then?
$GEN_003_01x06_00_05
I cannot be held accountable for nature not creating all apples equal. Apples are not Citizens of France.
$GEN_003_01x06_00_06
But you are the owner of this business, and you can be held accountable for the produce that you sell.
$GEN_003_01x06_00_07
I have never forced anyone to buy anything from me.
$GEN_003_01x06_00_08
So your customers consciously purchased spoiled food?
$GEN_003_01x06_00_09
They will buy carrots as black as coal if you lower the price by a few francs, but they still expect them to taste as though they were fresh out of the ground.
$GEN_003_01x06_00_10
He's insulting the people! Throw the scoundrel in chains!
$GEN_003_01x07_01_QTitle
Did you know your produce made your customers sick?
$GEN_003_01x07_01_00
Did you know your produce made your customers sick?
$GEN_003_01x07_01_01
If anyone can prove that my produce was at fault, I will gladly cover the cost of their treatment – or their funeral. They need only come forward.
$GEN_003_01x07_01_02
Try eating that muck yourself, and you’ll have your evidence!
$GEN_003_01x07_01_03
Let me remind you that witness testimonies will be taken into account.
$GEN_003_01x07_01_04
He was selling people shit, not food.
$GEN_003_01x07_01_05
Testimonies of jaundiced people who will do anything to hamper a wealthier man’s work. Worthy evidence indeed.
$GEN_003_02x03_02_QTitle
With regard to the violation of legal price limits–
$GEN_003_02x03_02_00
Before monsieur le juge asks, let me make one thing clear: legal price limits were never deliberately broken at my stalls. I find such accusations to be malicious and vile.
$GEN_003_02x03_02_01
Objection! You only corrected the prices upon the arrival of the inspectors.
$GEN_003_02x03_02_02
He deserves to rot in prison.
$GEN_003_02x03_02_03
The inspectors imposed a substantial fine on me that I paid without delay. I have already suffered the consequences of my negligence.
$GEN_003_02x03_02_04
A fine won’t stop him from peddling rotten tomatoes!
$GEN_003_02x04_03_QTitle
It seems your employees are rather prone to making mistakes.
$GEN_003_02x04_03_00
It seems your employees are rather prone to making mistakes.
$GEN_003_02x04_03_01
I would do everything myself if I could, but that is impossible.
$GEN_003_02x04_03_02
There was no one in Paris competent enough? Do you think so little of your fellow Citizens?
$GEN_003_02x04_03_03
Well, most people are dolts. The very fact that I must defend myself in court attests to that.
$GEN_003_02x04_03_04
Did the defendant offer adequate instruction to his subordinates?
$GEN_003_02x04_03_05
I own a chain of grocery stalls, not a parish school for the dim-witted.
$GEN_003_02x04_03_06
He's insulting us!
$GEN_003_02x05_04_QTitle
Could you explain why there have been so many complaints about your business over the years…?
$GEN_003_02x05_04_00
Could you explain why there have been so many complaints about your business over the years, and yet this is the first time you have been brought to justice?
$GEN_003_02x05_04_01
Maybe it is because most of those complaints have been nothing but nonsensical claims from jealous loafers?
$GEN_003_02x05_04_02
Are you so convinced that Marat and Robespierre will protect you?
$GEN_003_02x05_04_03
I am convinced that the law will protect me. Justice is on my side.
$GEN_003_02x05_04_04
What do you mean?
$GEN_003_02x05_04_05
The law is supposed to protect the innocent. It should be on the side of those who are wronged by–
$GEN_003_02x05_04_06
Spare us the speech. This is not a session of the National Convention.
$GEN_003_02x05_04_07
Did anyone understand any of that?
$GEN_003_02x05_04_08
Forgive me. My soul cries out for justice, so the statesmen you mentioned, Marat and Robespierre, will not have to deliver justice on my behalf.
$GEN_003_03x04_05_QTitle
We have analysed your ledgers and discovered that you have been violating legal price limits on a regular basis…
$GEN_003_03x04_05_00
We have analysed your ledgers and discovered that you have been violating legal price limits on a regular basis. Do you deny this accusation as well?
$GEN_003_03x04_05_01
These ledgers are kept by ordinary people who are prone to making mistakes. I will analyse them again and make proper amends–
$GEN_003_03x04_05_02
You are not at an administration office, Citizen Blanchot. These ledgers, in their current state, are evidence for the court.
$GEN_003_03x04_05_03
Those are mere accounting errors, a zero or a decimal put in the wrong place by mistake. It can all be explained. After all, are we not all friends of France here? Citizen Robespierre has assured me that we are.
$GEN_003_03x04_05_04
Has Citizen Robespierre also assured you that you can get away with falsifying records?
$GEN_003_03x04_05_05
Of course not…
$GEN_003_03x04_05_06
So why did you mention him?
$GEN_003_03x04_05_07
I…
$GEN_003_03x04_05_08
Robespierre isn’t a lackey of costermongers like him!
$GEN_003_03x04_05_09
Silence! Or I will adjourn the proceedings!
$GEN_003_03x04_05_10
Have they bribed the Judge as well?

Lingered with payment.
$GEN_003_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_01
He bribed the official to evade the ticket.
$GEN_003_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_02_00
Written mistake.

Robespierre’s support.
