	The family of a 33-year-old baker, Bastien Baudet, moved into an <a name="1" class="hidden">empty house</a> near section des Piques. They told the investigator that a few days earlier their house had been hit by a <a name="2" class="hidden">mortar round</a> and the shell's impact broke the ceiling and one of the walls.
$GEN_046_DOC_01_01
	A few days later, Baudet and his family were discovered by the owner of the seemingly empty house, Citizen Solé. It turned out that he had not left the house permanently. Several days earlier, a fire broke out in the neighbourhood and the Solé family temporarily ran away to stay with relatives in the suburbs.

	The legitimate owner of the house soon realised that his silver cutlery was gone, his food supplies were consumed, and some of the furniture had been chopped up and burned in the fireplace. During the interrogation of both families, we learned that the first meeting between the two sides ended with a <a name="6" class="hidden">struggle</a>, won by Baudet. Only with thanks to the intervention of the Guard was Citizen Solé able to be rid of the unwanted tenants, and the impetuous baker was detained.

Is your name Bastien Baudet?
$GEN_046_OnStart_01
Yes, monsieur le juge.
$GEN_046_OnStart_02
You moved into Citizen Solé’s apartment without permission.
$GEN_046_OnStart_03
There’s lots of empty apartments in Paris. We chose one of them because we didn’t have anywhere else to go.
$GEN_046_OnStart_04
A resourceful man will always find a way to care for his family!
$GEN_046_OnStart_05
Did you ask anyone for permission?
$GEN_046_OnStart_06
There was nobody to ask. It was empty, so we went inside. I couldn’t let my children sleep under the open sky.
$GEN_046_OnGuilty_00
Citizen Baudet, for burglary, theft, vandalism, and assault, I sentence you to the guillotine.
$GEN_046_OnGuilty_01
What will his family do without a father?
$GEN_046_OnGuilty_02
The court brought them all to ruin.
$GEN_046_OnGuilty_03
As it should be! If we ignored such behaviour, Paris would fall within a day.
$GEN_046_OnNotGuilty_00
Considering the circumstances, I cannot punish you. I can only hope that you will defend Paris with as much determination as you defend your family.
$GEN_046_OnNotGuilty_01
To let people go is one thing, but tell me, where will they stay?
$GEN_046_01x04_00_QTitle
What made you believe that Citizen Solé’s apartment had been abandoned?
$GEN_046_01x04_00_00
What made you believe that Citizen Solé’s apartment had been abandoned?
$GEN_046_01x04_00_01
Nobody was inside and the ash in the fireplace was cold. There’s been a bitter chill these nights, so if someone had been living there, there would’ve been a fire recently.
$GEN_046_01x04_00_02
Did you ask the neighbours about the owners? You should have started with that.
$GEN_046_01x04_00_03
No.
$GEN_046_01x04_00_04
Why?
$GEN_046_01x04_00_05
It never occurred to me that I should. I was too busy looking for food for my children.
$GEN_046_01x04_00_06
Is this why you sold their silver cutlery?
$GEN_046_01x04_00_07
Have you seen the price of butter? Nobody would give me food for wooden spoons.
$GEN_046_01x04_00_08
What about meat?! Do you know how much they ask for lamb?
$GEN_046_01x04_00_09
Bloody merchants!
$GEN_046_03x01_01_QTitle
Call in Citizen Solé as a witness.
$GEN_046_03x01_01_00
Call in Citizen Solé as a witness.
$GEN_046_03x01_01_02
Does the house belong to you?
$GEN_046_03x01_01_03
My wife inherited it from her great uncle.
$GEN_046_03x01_01_04
Why did you run from your home?
$GEN_046_03x01_01_05
One night, people started yelling about a fire. I looked from the window and the street was dark with smoke. I woke my wife and daughter and we escaped.
$GEN_046_03x01_01_06
Was it a large fire?
$GEN_046_03x01_01_07
As far as I knew, grenadiers could have come inside at any moment and started shooting and raping!
$GEN_046_03x01_01_08
You should have waited to see what was going on instead of running away from God knows what.
$GEN_046_03x01_01_09
What happened next?
$GEN_046_03x01_01_10
After two days, I wanted to make sure that our house wasn’t destroyed. To my surprise I saw that savage inside, chopping up my chairs and yelling at his wife!
$GEN_046_03x01_01_11
Did you attack him?
$GEN_046_03x01_01_12
I think I was yelling, but when I saw the door I became furious.
$GEN_046_03x01_01_13
Was it broken?
$GEN_046_03x01_01_14
Of course. When I demanded to know what they were doing there, that man started swinging the axe.
$GEN_046_02x01_02_QTitle
Is it true that your house was destroyed by artillery fire?
$GEN_046_02x01_02_00
Is it true that your house was destroyed by artillery fire?
$GEN_046_02x01_02_01
Indeed.
$GEN_046_02x01_02_02
Was anybody killed?
$GEN_046_02x01_02_03
My father-in-law was crushed by rubble and timber. Thank God that nothing happened to the children.
$GEN_046_02x01_02_04
A mortar round destroyed your house, and yet, you responded by destroying Citizen Solé's house?
$GEN_046_02x01_02_05
Are you talking about the furniture? I had to keep my children warm at night and I didn't know where they stored the firewood.
$GEN_046_02x01_02_06
Was there no brushwood nearby to burn?
$GEN_046_02x01_02_07
Was I really supposed to look for it when there was wood just lying around?
$GEN_046_02x01_02_08
Paris is dying and they worry about furniture.
$GEN_046_06x04_03_QTitle
Tell me more about the struggle between you two. Was it about the cutlery?
$GEN_046_06x04_03_00
Tell me more about the struggle between you two. Was it about the cutlery?
$GEN_046_06x04_03_01
You know, that fellow just came inside, yelling and looking around the house. I didn't know if he was really the owner or not.
$GEN_046_06x04_03_02
Do not pretend you were guarding another person's possessions.
$GEN_046_06x04_03_03
I'm just saying that he walked inside and started yelling.
$GEN_046_06x04_03_04
So you wanted to kick him out?
$GEN_046_06x04_03_05
Actually, he grabbed me by the shirt when I was chopping up the chairs, so I threatened him a little. That's all I did.
$GEN_046_06x04_03_06
How kind of him!
$GEN_046_06x04_03_07
Did you hurt him?
$GEN_046_06x04_03_08
As soon as he realised what was going on, he disappeared. We only heard footsteps on the stairs and a door slam.

$GEN_046_UNIQUE_QUESTION_00
Why did the Baudets leave their house?
$GEN_046_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_00_00
It was destroyed by a mortar round.
$GEN_046_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_00_00
The soldiers drove them away.
$GEN_046_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_00_01
They did not have anything to eat.
$GEN_046_UNIQUE_QUESTION_01
Did Baudet talk to anyone before entering the house?
$GEN_046_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_01_00
He did not talk to anyone.
$GEN_046_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_00
He talked to the neighbours.
$GEN_046_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_01
He talked to the owner of the building.
$GEN_046_UNIQUE_QUESTION_02
Why was the house empty?
$GEN_046_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_02_00
The host had fled from a fire.
$GEN_046_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_02_00
The inhabitants were evicted by the Guard.
$GEN_046_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_02_01
It was empty since the in-laws of Citizen Solé had died.
