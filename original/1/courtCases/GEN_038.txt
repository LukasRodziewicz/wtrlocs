A tragedy occurred in one of the tenements by the Seine, near the Pont Neuf – <a name="1" class="hidden">the fourth floor collapsed</a>. The tenants, horrified by the crash and ubiquitous dust, ran outside. Only after a few minutes did some of the braver men run upstairs to look for survivors and <a name="2" class="hidden">remove the corpses</a>.
$GEN_038_DOC_01_01
Rubble and timber buried <a name="3" class="hidden">two families</a> – twelve people. Three children managed to survive by hiding beneath a wooden table. Neighbours dug them out and carried them to the Hôtel-Dieu. We cannot comprehend what the orphans are going through, and they have not eaten or spoken for two days.
$GEN_038_DOC_01_02
The owner of the house testified that he had ordered the construction of <a name="5" class="hidden">an extra floor</a> a few years back. Works were supervised by architect Maurice Lortie. The National Guard found the architect, who was also the construction foreman, at an address given by the owner. Maurice Lortie was not surprised when the gendarmes knocked at his door, and he did not resist when they handcuffed him and took him to jail.

The people are angry and scared, and expect someone to be punished for this tragedy.
$GEN_038_OnStart_01
Your name?
$GEN_038_OnStart_02
Maurice Lortie, monsieur le juge.
$GEN_038_OnStart_03
Do you build houses?
$GEN_038_OnStart_04
That’s right. I have earned my living from construction and renovation for many years now.
$GEN_038_OnStart_05
Did the floor collapse because of your mistake?
$GEN_038_OnStart_06
I don’t know. I have worked at many houses since then.
$GEN_038_OnStart_07
Those children are dead because of you!
$GEN_038_OnStart_08
Let me just say that I always build the best work I can.
$GEN_038_OnGuilty_00
Architect Lortie shall be sent to the guillotine for the terrible, tragic death of two families.
$GEN_038_OnGuilty_01
Long live justice!
$GEN_038_OnPrison_00
I sentence Citizen Lortie to prison.
$GEN_038_OnPrison_01
Good, he deserves it!
$GEN_038_OnNotGuilty_00
There is no evidence against the defendant. Maurice Lortie is not guilty.
$GEN_038_OnNotGuilty_01
Can you repeat that while looking into the eyes of those orphans?
$GEN_038_05x04_00_QTitle
A few years ago, were you assigned to perform some construction work?
$GEN_038_05x04_00_00
A few years ago, were you assigned to perform some construction work?
$GEN_038_05x04_00_01
It was nine years ago. I was supposed to remove the roof, add one floor, then build a new roof.
$GEN_038_05x04_00_02
Is that a hard task?
$GEN_038_05x04_00_03
It is known that it is easier to build anew than to improve something already there.
$GEN_038_05x04_00_04
Did the owner have any objections regarding your work?
$GEN_038_05x04_00_05
If he did, I would have made as many corrections as necessary.
$GEN_038_05x04_00_06
Which floor was built by you?
$GEN_038_05x04_00_07
The attic, the fourth. Before that, the third floor was the attic.
$GEN_038_01x03_01_QTitle
Citizen, with your knowledge of construction, what could have led to this tragedy?
$GEN_038_01x03_01_00
Citizen, with your knowledge of construction, what could have led to this tragedy?
$GEN_038_01x03_01_01
I can’t be sure – pests, poor materials, too much load on the structure… every house is different. This should have been checked before the room fell on people’s heads.
$GEN_038_01x03_01_02
You did not mention a construction error.
$GEN_038_01x03_01_03
Yes, unfortunately that can also happen. I could have made a mistake in my calculations or wrongly assessed the quality of the timber.
$GEN_038_01x03_01_04
You are not denying it?
$GEN_038_01x03_01_05
If you judge that I have contributed to the death of those children, I will accept whatever punishment you choose. Two weeks ago, a disease took my wife and I no longer care what happens to me.
$GEN_038_03x04_02_QTitle
Call in the witness, Roland Lussier.
$GEN_038_03x04_02_00
Call in the witness, Roland Lussier.
$GEN_038_03x04_02_02
Are you the owner of the house where the floor collapsed?
$GEN_038_03x04_02_03
Yes, the floor in the attic collapsed and fell on the rooms beneath.
$GEN_038_02x01_03_QTitle
Did you talk to the tenants?
$GEN_038_02x01_03_00
Did you talk to the tenants? The ones that pulled the victims from the rubble?
$GEN_038_02x01_03_01
They came to me in the night, angry and hurt. I understand their pain as I, too, have children.
$GEN_038_02x01_03_02
Answer my question – did you talk to them?
$GEN_038_02x01_03_03
No, I was forced to hide inside my house and close the window shutters because they were throwing stones.
$GEN_038_02x01_03_04
So the building collapsed because of your mistake, and you did not even have the courage to talk to the victims?
$GEN_038_02x01_03_05
I’m a coward, I know.
$GEN_038_02x01_03_06
How did they know where to go?
$GEN_038_02x01_03_07
I don’t know. Only the owner of the tenement knew my address.
$GEN_038_WIT_00_A_QTitle
The apartments were small, correct?
$GEN_038_WIT_00_A_00
The apartments were small, correct?
$GEN_038_WIT_00_A_01
Two rooms, with one upstairs and one down. Not spacious, but I didn’t charge much.
$GEN_038_WIT_00_A_02
How many people lived upstairs?
$GEN_038_WIT_00_A_03
I don’t know, I didn’t count them.
$GEN_038_WIT_00_A_04
You did not know how many tenants you had?
$GEN_038_WIT_00_A_05
I own two tenements. As long as I get the rent, I’m not interested in what happens inside.
$GEN_038_WIT_00_A_06
Exploiter! Keen to take the money, and indifferent when it comes to his tenants!
$GEN_038_WIT_00_B_QTitle
Did the tenants complain about anything prior to the tragedy?
$GEN_038_WIT_00_B_00
Did the tenants complain about anything prior to the tragedy?
$GEN_038_WIT_00_B_01
They said something about squeaky floors, but that’s not unusual. They squeak at my place too, so what?
$GEN_038_WIT_00_B_02
Did you inspect the floors?
$GEN_038_WIT_00_B_03
I planned to, but this tragedy happened before I was able to.
$GEN_038_WIT_00_B_04
Thank God he managed to take their money!
