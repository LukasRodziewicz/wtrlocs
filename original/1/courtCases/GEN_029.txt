Edmond Malle, a 44-year-old undertaker working at the Montmartre Cemetery. The Parisian law enforcement authorities know him well, as it’s not the first time that he is sitting in the dock. Previously, this infamous pervert was <a name="2" class="hidden">sentenced for harassing</a> a young aristocrat. We have also learned from our informants that he sells bodies, as they are especially popular among students of medicine. The administration turned a blind eye because Malle worked for a beggarly wage and never asked for a raise.
$GEN_029_DOC_01_01
Malle was accused of murdering and desecrating the remains of Laura Dufort, the daughter of Marquis de Civrac, who has been missing for two weeks. The National Guard learned of the case from <a name="4" class="hidden">Jules Marot</a>, a student of medicine who bought a skull from the undertaker. What was supposed to be a study aide turned out to be the skull of Marot’s close friend, the missing Laura Dufort.
$GEN_029_DOC_01_02
Shocked by his own discovery, he became personally involved in the investigation. He assisted the police who searched Malle’s house and was actually the one to find the beheaded corpse of the girl <a name="6" class="hidden">hidden in a woodshed</a>.
$GEN_029_DOC_01_03
Later, the father of the murdered Laura testified that she <a name="7" class="hidden">often visited the cemetery</a>. She was visiting the tomb of her cousin, a Swiss Guard officer who died during the Siege of the Tuileries in 1792. It turns out that on numerous occasions the girl complained about the local undertakers, claiming that they <a name="8" class="hidden">pestered her in an inappropriate manner</a>. One of them supposedly chased her once, but it was hard to establish and punish the offender.

Evidence:
Laura Dufort’s <a name="9" class="hidden">skull</a>.

Please introduce yourself.
$GEN_029_OnStart_01
They call me… people call me the “Night Hag”.
$GEN_029_OnStart_02
I do not ask for your nickname, but your given name and surname.
$GEN_029_OnStart_03
Ah… well… my mum baptised me Edmond. Edmond Malle.
$GEN_029_OnStart_04
You are accused of murdering Marquis de Civrac Hector Dufort’s daughter, desecrating her remains, and selling her skull. How do you plead to those charges?
$GEN_029_OnStart_05
The remains were found at the defendant's place.
$GEN_029_OnStart_06
I ain’t seen ’em before.
$GEN_029_OnStart_07
Are you implying that you did not hide them there?
$GEN_029_OnStart_08
Me? No, I didn’t hurt ’er. Why would I hide ’er body?
$GEN_029_OnStart_09
Sure, someone probably dumped that body as a joke, right?
$GEN_029_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Citizen Edmond Malle to be guillotined! Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_029_OnGuilty_01
Paris will be a safer place.
$GEN_029_OnGuilty_02
Wonderful!
$GEN_029_OnGuilty_03
That’s only fair!
$GEN_029_OnGuilty_04
Sell his skull to students!
$GEN_029_OnPrison_00
[To jest mock i należy go zmienić!!!!]
$GEN_029_OnNotGuilty_00
The judgement for Edmond Malle is… not guilty! Take the defendant away.
$GEN_029_OnNotGuilty_01
If it wasn’t him, who killed her?
$GEN_029_OnNotGuilty_02
What a shame. It could have been such a beautiful beheading…
$GEN_029_09x05_00_QTitle
Is this the skull that you sold to Jules Marot?
$GEN_029_09x05_00_00
Is this the skull that you sold to Jules Marot?
$GEN_029_09x05_00_01
It didn’t look like that when ’e took it.
$GEN_029_09x05_00_02
What do you mean?
$GEN_029_09x05_00_03
Well, it’s bleached as white as alabaster, and I don’t have time for crap like that. You gotta boil it, let it dry in the sun, boil it again, let it dry… and they don’t pay much less for the dirty ones.
$GEN_029_09x05_00_04
Then who cleaned this skull?
$GEN_029_09x05_00_05
Ask ’e who bought it. The student, I mean.
$GEN_029_09x05_00_06
You seem perfectly able to clean bones, given your knowledge of the subject.
$GEN_029_09x05_00_07
I used to do it in the past, but like I said, it’s not worth it.
$GEN_029_09x05_00_08
Where do these freaks come from?
$GEN_029_01x08_01_QTitle
Did the defendant try to persuade Laura Dufort to commit adultery?
$GEN_029_01x08_01_00
Did the defendant try to persuade Laura Dufort to commit adultery?
$GEN_029_01x08_01_01
Oh, ya know what they say in the village, if you don’t at least whistle at a girlie, she’ll be mad at ya. But I didn’t do nothin’ more.
$GEN_029_01x08_01_02
Speak precisely. Did you call out to her or not?
$GEN_029_01x08_01_03
I called somethin’… you know, like, “Let’s go upstairs, sweetheart.” But it was just talkin’!
$GEN_029_01x08_01_04
How did the victim react to that… talking?
$GEN_029_01x08_01_05
One time, she cursed me all unladylike, threw stones at me, and ran through the gate. Made me a bit angry, true.
$GEN_029_01x08_01_06
There’s your motive! That flesh-eating savage wanted revenge!
$GEN_029_01x08_01_07
Is that why you killed her?
$GEN_029_01x08_01_08
No! I might be a skirt-chaser, but I'm no killer!
$GEN_029_02x03_02_QTitle
What do you think about the aristocracy?
$GEN_029_02x03_02_00
What do you think about the aristocracy?
$GEN_029_02x03_02_01
The pus-filled parasites should be beheaded. That’s in fashion now, right?
$GEN_029_02x03_02_02
Calling the Revolution fashion is an insult to this noble movement of the oppressed who–
$GEN_029_02x03_02_03
Enough! We all know the nature of the Revolution. So, the accused would like to kill every member of the aristocracy?
$GEN_029_02x03_02_04
Yup.
$GEN_029_02x03_02_05
This is a clear motive and conclusive evidence.
$GEN_029_02x03_02_06
Female aristocrats included?
$GEN_029_02x03_02_07
Oh no, no, ha ha! Them ladies are all right, monsieur le juge, we can make use of ’em. And noble ladies are, you know, less shabby.
$GEN_029_04x05_03_QTitle
Summon the witness.
$GEN_029_04x05_03_00
Summon the witness.
$GEN_029_04x05_03_02
Please introduce yourself.
$GEN_029_04x05_03_03
Jules Marot, monsieur le juge.
$GEN_029_06x03_04_QTitle
How did the remains of Laura Dufort come to be inside the defendant’s woodshed?
$GEN_029_06x03_04_00
How did the remains of Laura Dufort come to be inside the defendant’s woodshed?
$GEN_029_06x03_04_01
How should I know?!
$GEN_029_06x03_04_02
Confess already and be done with it!
$GEN_029_06x03_04_03
It is hard to ignore obvious conclusions when one finds a decapitated body in a construction used by the defendant.
$GEN_029_06x03_04_04
Come on, sir! If I… ya know… did this ’n’ that, I’d bury ’er, instead of keeping ’er in a shed! I got keys to the cemetery, I could dump ’er in a crypt and they’d never have found ’er.
$GEN_029_06x03_04_05
Do not listen to his excuses. If he took her to his place to rape and murder her, then he would hide the body in his shed because it was nearby.
$GEN_029_06x03_04_06
How do you respond to that?
$GEN_029_06x03_04_07
I didn’t kill nobody! Only an ’asp secures the shed. Anyone can enter it and drop a deader! That she was lying at my place don’t mean I killed ’er!
$GEN_029_06x03_04_08
If the accused did not kill her, then who did?
$GEN_029_06x03_04_09
I don’t know, maybe that student?
$GEN_029_06x03_04_10
Shameless rapist!
$GEN_029_09x04_05_QTitle
Do you admit to removing the skull of the victim…?
$GEN_029_09x04_05_00
Do you admit to removing the skull of the victim and selling it to Citizen Marot?
$GEN_029_09x04_05_01
I didn’t remove nothin’, and the skull I sold weren’t this lady’s.
$GEN_029_09x04_05_02
So you admit to having desecrated corpses?
$GEN_029_09x04_05_03
Yes. I ’ave to or I couldn’t afford neither bread nor water. But it weren’t ’er skull.
$GEN_029_09x04_05_04
Whose skull was it?
$GEN_029_09x04_05_05
No idea. I take them from random graves of the poorest fellas, only checkin’ if they ain’t damaged.
$GEN_029_09x04_05_06
Disgusting!
$GEN_029_09x04_05_07
Who allows that?!
$GEN_029_09x07_06_QTitle
Did the accused know Laura Dufort?
$GEN_029_09x07_06_00
Did the accused know Laura Dufort?
$GEN_029_09x07_06_01
Sure did. She was visitin’ this Guard’s tomb, always leavin’ a flower, always sayin’ the Lord’s Prayer. Such a good young lady…
$GEN_029_09x07_06_02
Could you say that you two were close?
$GEN_029_09x07_06_03
No. I always greeted ’er politely, tried talkin’ to ’er, and she just hissed at me like a kitten. And I weren’t the only one.
$GEN_029_09x07_06_04
Were you aggressive towards her?
$GEN_029_09x07_06_05
Not at all, only banterin’ a bit.
$GEN_029_09x07_06_06
What a shameless pest…
$GEN_029_09x07_06_07
Was there anyone else who would harass her on the grounds of the cemetery?
$GEN_029_09x07_06_08
Sure thing! There were drunkards of course, and also the lad who bought the skull from me who’s now callin’ me a murderer.
$GEN_029_09x07_06_09
You knew him prior to selling him the skull?
$GEN_029_09x07_06_10
Only by sight. I didn’t even know ’e’s studyin’ to be a doctor.
$GEN_029_WIT_00_A_QTitle
What was your relationship with the murdered Laura Dufort?
$GEN_029_WIT_00_A_00
What was your relationship with the murdered Laura Dufort?
$GEN_029_WIT_00_A_01
She was the closest person in the world to me. I have known her my entire life, and this disgusting vagrant… Monsieur le juge, I loved her.
$GEN_029_WIT_00_A_02
Did she love you back?
$GEN_029_WIT_00_A_03
Unfortunately she did not, but I am certain she would sooner or later have developed feelings for me!
$GEN_029_WIT_01_A_QTitle
Are you sure that the skull purchased from the accused…?
$GEN_029_WIT_01_A_00
Are you sure that the skull purchased from the accused belongs to the victim?
$GEN_029_WIT_01_A_01
Absolutely.
$GEN_029_WIT_01_A_02
What gives you such confidence in this conviction? Can you prove it?
$GEN_029_WIT_01_A_03
Laura lost her right upper incisor as a child… unfortunately, it was my fault. That was how I knew it belonged to her. Good Lord…
$GEN_029_WIT_01_A_04
It could be mere coincidence.
$GEN_029_WIT_01_A_05
Monsieur le juge, I know what I am talking about. Everything looks as it should: the jawline, the distance between the eyes… That scoundrel probably raped Laura, killed her, and then took off her head!
$GEN_029_WIT_01_A_06
Did Malle tell you where he found the skull?
$GEN_029_WIT_01_A_07
Yes, but he lied. He supposedly dug it up from the old part of the cemetery.
$GEN_029_WIT_01_A_08
When did you notice whose skull was in your possession?
$GEN_029_WIT_01_A_09
Well… Only when I started sketching it did the resemblance strike me.
$GEN_029_WIT_01_B_QTitle
How would you describe the relationship between the accused and the victim?
$GEN_029_WIT_01_B_00
How would you describe the relationship between the accused and the victim?
$GEN_029_WIT_01_B_01
That wretch kept harassing her whenever she came to the cemetery!
$GEN_029_WIT_01_B_02
Did you see it with your own eyes?
$GEN_029_WIT_01_B_03
No, but… Laura told me, and that’s enough to prove his motive. He deserves the guillotine!
$GEN_029_WIT_01_B_04
What exactly did she tell you?
$GEN_029_WIT_01_B_05
That he was yelling at her, making disgusting gestures, and constantly barring her way, forcing her to weave between the tombs to avoid him.
$GEN_029_WIT_01_B_06
So you did not always accompany her to the cemetery?
$GEN_029_WIT_01_B_07
I came with her on only one occasion, as she preferred to go alone.
