The defendant is… Well, you know her very well, monsieur le juge, and you know best what she has been accused of, but as a diligent clerk, I shall continue for the sake of thoroughness. She has been accused of attempted murder.
$FAB_021_DOC_01_01
Yesterday, Mathilde Fidèle used <a name="2" class="hidden">a kitchen knife</a> to stab her husband, Judge Alexis Fidèle, at the entrance to the Revolutionary Tribunal. According to witnesses, she was overpowered immediately and without trouble, as the defendant quickly threw her weapon to the ground and <a name="3" class="hidden">offered no resistance</a>.
$FAB_021_DOC_01_02
Unfortunately, I have to record an additional piece of information. It seems that the defendant had <a name="4" class="hidden">an affair</a> with the former Commander-in-Chief of the National Guard, François Hanriot. I was able to determine that they were seen together several times after he applied for the position as commander-in-chief. When we searched Hanriot’s apartment after his death, we found letters suggesting a relationship with a married woman. They contained no names, so it was not easy to ascertain who the commander’s lover was, but now we have no doubt. At the same time, a potential motive for the murder has been revealed – as we know, Hanriot was killed after a <a name="5" class="hidden">skirmish defending Robespierre</a> from our troops.

As for other gossip concerning your <a name="6" class="hidden">family relationships</a> I will remain silent, as you know more than I do about what is true.
$FAB_021_OnStart_00
The defendant may introduce herself.
$FAB_021_OnStart_01
Don’t make jokes. You know who I am.
$FAB_021_OnStart_02
I am not in the mood for humour. Speak loudly.
$FAB_021_OnStart_03
Mathilde Fidèle, the wife of the Judge presiding here today. Are you happy now?
$FAB_021_OnGuilty_00
There can be no other sentence – she is guilty. I am sorry, Mathilde.
$FAB_021_OnGuilty_01
Quick to the guillotine, then.
$FAB_021_OnGuilty_02
What a drama.
$FAB_021_OnGuilty_03
He’s willing to behead his own wife?
$FAB_021_OnNotGuilty_00
Let her go. Release my wife.
$FAB_021_OnNotGuilty_01
This isn’t the first time you have broken the law for your own needs. It’s a matter of habit, isn’t it?
$FAB_021_OnNotGuilty_02
I cannot comment on that. I simply cannot.
$FAB_021_OnNotGuilty_03
Has he forgiven her?
$FAB_021_01x03_00_QTitle
Why were you so calm during the arrest?
$FAB_021_01x03_00_00
Why were you so calm during the arrest?
$FAB_021_01x03_00_01
I stabbed you in public. How could I escape?
$FAB_021_01x03_00_02
That is true. You stabbed your own husband. Did you even feel anything?
$FAB_021_01x03_00_03
I only feel sick when I see my husband. It has been like that for a long time now.
$FAB_021_01x03_00_04
So you feel no remorse, or crisis of conscience?
$FAB_021_01x03_00_05
My only regret is that I stabbed him too lightly.
$FAB_021_01x03_00_06
A real beast.
$FAB_021_01x03_00_07
And you are telling me this to my face?
$FAB_021_01x03_00_08
You deserved to die. Who else could say that to you?
$FAB_021_01x04_01_QTitle
Was your affair the reason for the attack?
$FAB_021_01x04_01_00
Was your affair the reason for the attack?
$FAB_021_01x04_01_01
You really know nothing about your own family.
$FAB_021_01x04_01_02
Answer!
$FAB_021_01x04_01_03
Restrain yourself, Antoine.
$FAB_021_01x04_01_04
My affair was not the reason, but yours were – your affairs with women, power, money, and alcohol. You weren’t able to hide them, and you didn’t want to give them up.
$FAB_021_01x04_01_05
There were no affairs!
$FAB_021_01x04_01_06
No? And your lust for power? You crave it! How many people have you killed to get it?
$FAB_021_01x04_01_07
You are insinuating–
$FAB_021_01x04_01_08
I’m insinuating nothing, I’m stating a fact. Your lust for power has led our family to the brink of disaster, and you ask me about my affair?
$FAB_021_04x05_02_QTitle
How long did your affair last?
$FAB_021_04x05_02_00
How long did your affair last?
$FAB_021_04x05_02_01
Since Hanriot came asking for you to support his application for the post of commander-in-chief. So, quite a long time.
$FAB_021_04x05_02_02
How were you able to keep it secret all this time?
$FAB_021_04x05_02_03
My husband was blinded by the splendour that surrounded him, by the fighting and bloodshed. He no longer cared about the details–
$FAB_021_04x05_02_04
I did not think that I needed to watch over my own wife.
$FAB_021_04x05_02_05
And I didn’t think I’d have to kill my husband to get rid of him. Giving myself to another was certainly of no help, as you didn’t even notice! At least you finally noticed something when I pushed the knife between your ribs.
$FAB_021_02x06_03_QTitle
How did you choose your weapon?
$FAB_021_02x06_03_00
How did you choose your weapon?
$FAB_021_02x06_03_01
I didn’t think long. It was supposed to be something sharp and effective, and easy to have at hand when I needed it.
$FAB_021_02x06_03_02
You speak of the matter without any emotion…
$FAB_021_02x06_03_03
What did you expect? You wanted to make the choices, but which ones? You’ve become someone above everyone else, and been given the possibility to choose who will live and who will not. But, unlike us, you don’t want to suffer the consequences.
$FAB_021_02x06_03_04
It’s almost made you like God, as He is the only one free from the burden of His choices – but you are still human. You want special treatment, and yet you are only one of millions. What makes you feel more important than those who have helped to elevate us?
$FAB_021_02x06_03_05
Who are you talking about?
$FAB_021_02x06_03_06
Your blind desire to decide has made you a fly in their ointment, but necessary to achieve their work’s perfection. You want power, you want to be the first, and yet you will only get what you give.
$FAB_021_02x06_03_07
This hatred cannot be stopped. Her prattling ravings show the woman has gone insane.
$FAB_021_04x06_04_QTitle
When you had your affair, did you consider the impact it would have on your family?
$FAB_021_04x06_04_00
When you had your affair, did you consider the impact it would have on your family?
$FAB_021_04x06_04_01
I certainly hoped it would make an impact. I hoped for my husband to disappear, to leave, and for my family to survive. At least some part of it.
$FAB_021_04x06_04_02
As far as I know, you still hold this hope.
$FAB_021_04x06_04_03
As far as you know. I’m no longer fooling myself, I will soon be dead, and the fact that my family is falling apart will no longer be my problem.
$FAB_021_04x06_04_04
Not your problem? How can you say that? You are a mother–
$FAB_021_04x06_04_05
Don’t you dare… Don’t! A mother?! One of my sons was hanged, and the other is traumatized after getting strapped to a torture chair. And why? Because of your hunger for power. Yours! You, sitting there, are to blame!
$FAB_021_04x06_04_06
Hold your tongue–
$FAB_021_04x06_04_07
I had to watch it happening, accept everything, and I couldn’t stop it. You played with our lives! That knife between your ribs is the first time I’ve ever had the chance to change anything.
$FAB_021_06x05_05_QTitle
How did you react to the death of the traitor, Hanriot?
$FAB_021_06x05_05_00
How did you react to the death of the traitor, Hanriot?
$FAB_021_06x05_05_01
…
$FAB_021_06x05_05_02
Do you understand the question?
$FAB_021_06x05_05_03
I took it badly, but it was far worse to sleep in the same bed as the man responsible for his death – my husband.
$FAB_021_06x05_05_04
Hanriot betrayed France.
$FAB_021_06x05_05_05
No more than the Judge of this Tribunal has betrayed his family, which he has done repeatedly.
$FAB_021_06x05_05_06
You have always been the most important person to me!
$FAB_021_06x05_05_07
And now you also betray yourself. You know all too well that power is on a pedestal. Is that how they bought you? Build power in Paris! Pass sentences! Did they forget to mention your family?
$FAB_021_06x05_05_08
They did…
$FAB_021_06x05_05_09
I guess you didn’t hear properly then, because your family has just fallen apart.
