Aimée Danet, a 19-year-old orphan who is currently employed at a loomshop, is accused of being a Monarchist. Prior to the Revolution, the defendant was working as a kitchen maid in the Parisian residence of Xavier de Borda, <a name="2" class="hidden">the Baron de Lezines</a>, who was a sworn supporter of Citizen Capet. After the beginning of the Revolution he was accused of plotting against France. However, because of insufficient evidence he was only stripped of his title and fortune.
$GEN_025_DOC_1_01
Danet was denounced by the head of the loomshop, 56-year-old Louis Berthier. He accused her of <a name="3" class="hidden">supporting Monarchists</a> and having Counter-Revolutionary views.
$GEN_025_DOC_1_02
Aimée allegedly committed <a name="4" class="hidden">theft</a> of groceries from the loomshop pantry. It would have been an ordinary crime, if not for the fact that she then handed the food to Xavier de Borda. After his trial, the former Baron started living on the street, dressed in rags and begging for bread. 
$GEN_025_DOC_1_03
The crime was witnessed by another worker, 51-year-old Barbara Cuvier, who also worked at the Baron’s residency, though only for a short period of time. She testified to having seen Aimée take bread and cheese from the pantry and give it to de Borda. He also nagged other employees of the loomshop, asking them to bring him food <a name="5" class="hidden">in exchange for money</a>.
$GEN_025_DOC_1_04
The former aristocrat was arrested for vagrancy. During the interrogation, he confirmed everything that we had previously established. However, he denied recognising Aimée and offering her anything for the food.
$GEN_025_OnStart_00
Bourgeois whore!
$GEN_025_OnStart_01
Don’t waste the guillotine on her, bring her to us!
$GEN_025_OnStart_02
The defendant wanted to be human in inhuman times. Or maybe she was just stupid in times that have no mercy for stupidity? I cannot decide which epitaph will look better on her tombstone.
$GEN_025_OnStart_03
Citizen, what is your name?
$GEN_025_OnStart_04
I’m… Aimée. Aimée Danet.
$GEN_025_OnStart_05
What can you say in your defence?
$GEN_025_OnStart_06
I… I didn’t do anything…
$GEN_025_OnStart_07
She is obviously lying. The files contain a detailed description of the reason for her trial.
$GEN_025_OnStart_08
Citizen Danet, the principal of the weaving shop claims that you were helping a sworn Counter-Revolutionary, Xavier de Borda, the former Baron de Lezines, with food.
$GEN_025_OnStart_09
I just fed a poor man. I didn’t mean no harm.
$GEN_025_OnStart_10
Why did you not feed a child, instead of a former rich man?
$GEN_025_OnStart_11
Should I pity an old man less than a child?
$GEN_025_OnStart_12
She’s lying, as Monarchists always do!
$GEN_025_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Aimée Danet to be guillotined! Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_025_OnGuilty_01
I admire your commitment to the cause.
$GEN_025_OnGuilty_02
That’s the way to do it. Good man!
$GEN_025_OnGuilty_03
One less leech.
$GEN_025_OnGuilty_04
Such a pretty face gone…
$GEN_025_OnNotGuilty_00
The verdict in the case of Aimée Danet is… not guilty! Lead the defendant out.
$GEN_025_OnNotGuilty_01
I see how you could believe her explanations, though it is a pity that your intuition was not strong enough for you to see through them.
$GEN_025_OnNotGuilty_02
He let a thief go!
$GEN_025_OnNotGuilty_03
Are we letting Counter-Revolutionaries go now?!
$GEN_025_OnNotGuilty_04
You are an enemy of the people!
$GEN_025_02x03_00_QTitle
Do you support the Revolution?
$GEN_025_02x03_00_00
Do you support the Revolution?
$GEN_025_02x03_00_01
Yes, although now more often than before the cupboard is bare…
$GEN_025_02x03_00_02
Probably because in the past you were among the privileged who spent their time in palaces.
$GEN_025_02x03_00_03
During the Ancien Régime we didn’t even have cupboards!
$GEN_025_02x03_00_04
If only you could’ve seen how we lived in those palaces…
$GEN_025_02x03_00_05
So the Revolution has disappointed you, and you decided to help its enemies?
$GEN_025_02x03_00_06
No, I just fed a beggar who asked for a slice of bread.
$GEN_025_02x03_00_07
That beggar was the former Baron de Borda, recognised by the court as an enemy of France and its people.
$GEN_025_02x03_00_08
The Baron had really changed. He’s skinny, grey haired, looked like he would faint any minute.
$GEN_025_02x03_00_09
I wonder if he ever took pity on anyone?
$GEN_025_02x04_01_QTitle
Did the groceries you gave to Xavier de Borda belong to you?
$GEN_025_02x04_01_00
Did the groceries you gave to Xavier de Borda belong to you?
$GEN_025_02x04_01_01
I… I took them from Mr Berthier’s table because–
$GEN_025_02x04_01_02
So they were not yours?
$GEN_025_02x04_01_03
No.
$GEN_025_02x04_01_04
So you did steal them! Say it!
$GEN_025_02x04_01_05
Order! Does the defendant admit to stealing groceries belonging to Mr Berthier?
$GEN_025_02x04_01_06
No. Mr Berthier hasn’t paid me for the last two months. It’s him who should be tried for theft!
$GEN_025_02x04_01_07
The fact that you were not getting your salary does not give you permission to steal Citizen Berthier’s possessions. You should have come to us.
$GEN_025_02x04_01_08
It’s his fault that I can’t afford bread for myself, not to mention the others too. He can deduct it from what he owes me.
$GEN_025_02x04_01_09
That is the mindset from the former regime. “I am entitled to this,” they say, and take what they want without thinking of others.
$GEN_025_02x04_01_10
Berthier is no saint either.
$GEN_025_01x03_02_QTitle
Why did you help Citizen de Borda?
$GEN_025_01x03_02_00
Why did you help Citizen de Borda?
$GEN_025_01x03_02_01
He was starving, and I know how hunger feels…
$GEN_025_01x03_02_02
He was also sentenced for Counter-Revolutionary activities which you, as his former employee, knew very well.
$GEN_025_01x03_02_03
I only saw a dirty, lice-ridden, poor man. How could I recognise the Baron in him? I’m still not convinced it was him.
$GEN_025_01x03_02_04
Are you trying to convince us that you did not recognise a man for whom you worked for so many years?
$GEN_025_01x03_02_05
So skinny, missing his hairpiece and rich clothing? He wouldn’t recognise himself.
$GEN_025_01x03_02_06
Impossible.
$GEN_025_01x03_02_07
Would you have done the same if you knew the identity of the beggar?
$GEN_025_01x03_02_08
Criminals have to eat like any other person. He’s just a beggar. What harm can he do to France?
$GEN_025_01x02_03_QTitle
How long did you work for the former Baron de Lezines?
$GEN_025_01x02_03_00
How long did you work for the former Baron de Lezines?
$GEN_025_01x02_03_01
A few years. I don’t remember exactly, I was first brought to the kitchen as a child.
$GEN_025_01x02_03_02
So you had enough time to examine his face and remember it.
$GEN_025_01x02_03_03
The Baron never entered the kitchen and we were forbidden from going into the rooms. I usually saw him through the window, when he was riding on a horse to hunt.
$GEN_025_01x02_03_04
Did you hear that? He was hunting, that big shot.
$GEN_025_01x02_03_05
Are you saying that if he entered the kitchen when you were working for him, you would not have known who he was?
$GEN_025_01x02_03_06
That beggar looked familiar, but I didn’t remember why.
$GEN_025_04x05_04_QTitle
What did you get from the Baron in exchange for food?
$GEN_025_04x05_04_00
What did you get from the Baron in exchange for food?
$GEN_025_04x05_04_01
A kind word. What else would a starving beggar have given to me? The only other thing he could offer would be lice.
$GEN_025_04x05_04_02
Witnesses claim that he promised you a lot of money from his hidden fortune.
$GEN_025_04x05_04_03
He was going crazy from hunger. Why would he live on the street if he had money? Who would believe such a thing?
$GEN_025_04x05_04_04
People like him always have some gold hidden!
$GEN_025_04x05_04_05
Who knows, maybe he was living there because he did not want to draw attention to himself?
$GEN_025_04x05_04_06
If he had money he could just buy food in a store.
$GEN_025_04x05_04_07
That is true.
$GEN_025_04x05_04_08
Unless he could not because nobody would trade with an enemy of the Revolution.

Death for a good heart, the guillotine for naiveté. What happened to you, France…
$GEN_025_UNIQUE_QUESTION_00
Where did the woman get the food?
$GEN_025_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_00_00
She admitted to stealing it from her employer.
$GEN_025_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_00_00
She claims it was her dinner.
$GEN_025_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_00_01
She said she had bought it for the beggar.
$GEN_025_UNIQUE_QUESTION_01
How much had the Baron changed since the end of his trial?
$GEN_025_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_01_00
He had become skinny and grey haired.
$GEN_025_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_00
He developed a hunch and many wrinkles.
$GEN_025_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_01
He lost his hair and teeth.
$GEN_025_UNIQUE_QUESTION_02
How long did Danet work for the Baron?
$GEN_025_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_02_00
Ever since she was a child.
$GEN_025_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_02_00
A few months.
$GEN_025_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_02_01
Only a few days.
