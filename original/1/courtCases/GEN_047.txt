	During a <a name="1" class="hidden">fight</a> in the suburbs, four lancers from enemy troops were detained by our militia regiment. Our soldiers first shot down their horses, then <a name="2" class="hidden">stormed the inn</a> which the cavalrymen had run to on foot.
$GEN_047_DOC_01_01
	Restrained and gagged, the enemies were taken to the temporary headquarters located in a small <a name="3" class="hidden">farm in the country</a>. There was no time for interrogation, as a counter-offensive was still underway. Instead, the prisoners were detained in a storage cellar guarded by 17-year-old Private Victor Devalle. Following protocol, he was armed with a rifle and pistol.
$GEN_047_DOC_01_02
	In the evening, one of the officers wanted to move the lancers to the general staff. He found <a name="5" class="hidden">the guard was sleeping</a> near the door and one of the cavalrymen had managed to escape. His companions must have lifted him up and helped him to remove the old, rusty bars. The escapee gave away the location of our field staff and we lost our prisoners.
$GEN_047_OnStart_00
Are you Private Victor Devalle?
$GEN_047_OnStart_01
Yes, monsieur le juge.
$GEN_047_OnStart_02
How old are you?
$GEN_047_OnStart_03
Seventeen, monsieur le juge.
$GEN_047_OnStart_04
In my day, children were more responsible than that fellow!
$GEN_047_OnStart_05
How long have you been serving in the army?
$GEN_047_OnStart_06
For three weeks, monsieur le juge.
$GEN_047_OnStart_07
And you have already managed to commit a war crime?
$GEN_047_OnStart_08
Do you know the possible consequences that await you? Do you want to say something?
$GEN_047_OnStart_09
Yes, sir. I did not intend to let the prisoner go free.
$GEN_047_OnGuilty_00
Soldier, your negligent attitude towards your duties could have cost many people their lives. We will make an example of your execution.
$GEN_047_OnGuilty_01
What savage kills a kid because he was sleepy?
$GEN_047_OnNotGuilty_00
By falling asleep you put many lives in danger, but we still need you in our ranks. You are free to go, Private.
$GEN_047_OnNotGuilty_01
We should not be so lenient. We are at war.
$GEN_047_OnNotGuilty_02
Yes, soldiers should fight, not rot in a cell!
$GEN_047_OnNotGuilty_03
What? The whole unit could have been killed because of him!
$GEN_047_01x05_00_QTitle
Why were you so tired on the day of the incident? Were you fighting?
$GEN_047_01x05_00_00
Why were you so tired on the day of the incident? Were you fighting?
$GEN_047_01x05_00_01
Only in the morning, monsieur le juge.
$GEN_047_01x05_00_02
Why?
$GEN_047_01x05_00_03
My column found itself under artillery fire. There was panic, and we escaped.
$GEN_047_01x05_00_04
In the old days we fought like men. What happened to us?
$GEN_047_01x05_00_05
Did you run too, soldier?
$GEN_047_01x05_00_06
A man standing right next to me was torn in half by round shot… I…
$GEN_047_01x05_00_07
You escaped because you were scared?
$GEN_047_01x05_00_08
Yes, I was scared.
$GEN_047_01x05_00_09
Let me guess, you were also too scared to shoot the prisoners…
$GEN_047_01x05_00_10
If I hadn’t been sleeping–
$GEN_047_01x05_00_11
You’d better stop talking, boy.
$GEN_047_03x04_01_QTitle
The headquarters were located at a farm?
$GEN_047_03x04_01_00
The headquarters were located at a farm?
$GEN_047_03x04_01_01
It was an old house, more like a shack, surrounded by a few small buildings – a pigsty, a hen house, a woodshed.
$GEN_047_03x04_01_02
How did the prisoner escape?
$GEN_047_03x04_01_03
They must have pulled the bars out. The building was barely holding itself together, monsieur le juge. Just a slight push was enough…
$GEN_047_03x04_01_04
In houses like that, even the door was likely to fall off.
$GEN_047_03x04_01_05
You did not hear anything?
$GEN_047_03x04_01_06
No, monsieur le juge. I only wanted to close my eyes for a few minutes. I hadn’t had much sleep at the time.
$GEN_047_03x04_01_07
A few weeks in the army, and you are already exhausted?
$GEN_047_03x04_01_08
…
$GEN_047_03x04_01_09
He’s young. If he didn’t want to sleep, he wouldn’t.
$GEN_047_03x04_01_10
An officer woke you up?
$GEN_047_03x04_01_11
Captain Berryer. He was so angry that he almost shot me on the spot, monsieur le juge.
$GEN_047_03x04_01_12
They could have taken your weapon and killed someone…
$GEN_047_03x04_01_13
I know that, sir.
$GEN_047_02x04_02_QTitle
I see in the files that the prisoners would not give up without a fight.
$GEN_047_02x04_02_00
I see in the files that the prisoners would not give up without a fight.
$GEN_047_02x04_02_01
I heard they hid in a house and fought with bayonets.
$GEN_047_02x04_02_02
Yet your command decided to lock them in a cellar and leave a lone child to guard them? What would you have done if they had started running?
$GEN_047_02x04_02_03
If you were not asleep at that moment, of course.
$GEN_047_02x04_02_04
I would have shot them.
$GEN_047_02x04_02_05
Sure, that kid would shoot someone.
$GEN_047_02x04_02_06
Have you ever killed a man?
$GEN_047_02x04_02_07
…
$GEN_047_02x04_02_08
Answer the question.
$GEN_047_02x04_02_09
Yes, the day before. We were fighting with bayonets and I pierced someone’s head right through…
$GEN_047_05x03_03_QTitle
How many soldiers were in the headquarters when the prisoner escaped?
$GEN_047_05x03_03_00
How many soldiers were in the headquarters when the prisoner escaped?
$GEN_047_05x03_03_01
About 30, I think. And the officers too, but they were sitting a bit further away. The cellar was near the pigsty, under the woodshed.
$GEN_047_05x03_03_02
Were there any other guards?
$GEN_047_05x03_03_03
Exactly! Thirty culprits but only one scapegoat!
$GEN_047_05x03_03_04
I think they were patrolling along the fence.
$GEN_047_05x03_03_05
And none of them caught the escapee?
$GEN_047_05x03_03_06
Apparently not, monsieur le juge.
$GEN_047_05x03_03_07
Call in the witness.
$GEN_047_05x03_03_09
Please introduce yourself.
$GEN_047_05x03_03_10
Captain Berryer.
$GEN_047_05x03_03_11
That is all you have to say about yourself?
$GEN_047_05x03_03_12
I do not have time for this. The enemy is coming at us while we are wasting our time on traitors.
$GEN_047_WIT_00_A_QTitle
Do you consider this young man to be a traitor?
$GEN_047_WIT_00_A_00
Do you consider this young man to be a traitor?
$GEN_047_WIT_00_A_01
It is simple. He let a prisoner escape, which allowed the enemy to–
$GEN_047_WIT_00_A_02
I read the files.
$GEN_047_WIT_00_A_03
Then why are you asking ridiculous questions?
$GEN_047_WIT_00_A_04
Is your judgement not too harsh?
$GEN_047_WIT_00_A_05
War knows no mercy. We must be aware of the price of victory, and the punishment awaiting those who harm our cause.
$GEN_047_WIT_00_A_06
He was well aware of his responsibilities.
$GEN_047_WIT_00_B_QTitle
Why did you leave such an inexperienced soldier on watch?
$GEN_047_WIT_00_B_00
Why did you leave such an inexperienced soldier on watch?
$GEN_047_WIT_00_B_01
So that he would become more experienced. Do you know of an easier task than sitting on a stool and making sure that four exhausted, injured men don’t escape from a locked room?
$GEN_047_WIT_00_B_02
Every soldier must be of some use.
$GEN_047_WIT_00_B_03
Were you aware of the defendant’s exhaustion when you gave him the order?
$GEN_047_WIT_00_B_04
Obviously. That is why I told him to guard the prisoners in a safe place. Meanwhile, I and my people were supporting Colonel de Montigny’s flank, who was engaged with enemy troops.

$GEN_047_UNIQUE_QUESTION_00
Was the defendant fighting on the day of the incident?
$GEN_047_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_00_00
He was, but his unit deserted the battlefield.
$GEN_047_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_00_00
He was, and proved to be a hero.
$GEN_047_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_00_01
He spent the whole day behind the lines.
$GEN_047_UNIQUE_QUESTION_01
How did the lancers manage to escape?
$GEN_047_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_01_00
They pulled the bars from the window.
$GEN_047_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_00
They prised the door open.
$GEN_047_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_01
They dug their way out.
