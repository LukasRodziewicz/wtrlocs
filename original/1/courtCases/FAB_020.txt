The defendant is young officer Gérard Boutin. Strong evidence suggests that he killed the former archbishop of Paris, Jean-Baptiste Gobel.
$FAB_020_DOC_01_01
Yesterday afternoon, in the victim’s place of residence, a <a name="1" class="hidden">pistol shot</a> was heard. Neighbours entered Gobel’s room immediately and found a young man with a smoking gun in his hand. The victim was lying on the floor with a <a name="2" class="hidden">hole in his chest</a>. They called the Guard immediately, as the young man refused to put the murder weapon away. Due to the position of the victim, the crime scene was attended by <a name="3" class="hidden">Commander-in-Chief François Hanriot</a> himself. As the latter entered the room, he noticed that Boutin had finished loading the gun and was ready to shoot again – this time intending to <a name="4" class="hidden">kill himself</a>. Hanriot engaged in negotiations, and after almost 20 minutes was able to convince the officer to lower the weapon. Guards immediately grabbed and incapacitated the murderer before leading him away to jail.
$FAB_020_DOC_01_02
During a short interrogation in his cell, <a name="5" class="hidden">the defendant remained silent</a>. Hanriot was present during this attempt to obtain information, which seems strange to me, but he is the commander in-chief, so he can do as he pleases. Unfortunately, an incident took place. After the investigators left, one of the guards returned to the cell, threw himself at the defendant, and <a name="6" class="hidden">kicked him several times</a>, shouting, “What do you know about Robespierre?! What do you know about the Commander?!”
$FAB_020_DOC_01_03
I try to avoid rumours, but one piece of gossip could be crucial to this case. Monsieur le juge is probably unaware, like most Parisians, that it is said young Boutin is Gobel’s <a name="7" class="hidden">illegitimate son</a>. The very same who has been the talk of the town lately. If that is true, we are dealing with both a tragedy and a mystery – why would a son kill his own father? I have not been able to determine the truth. Perhaps you will.
$FAB_020_OnStart_00
We would like the defendant to state his name.
$FAB_020_OnStart_01
Gérard Boutin, son of Jean-Baptiste Gobel.
$FAB_020_OnStart_02
Incredible.
$FAB_020_OnGuilty_00
He is guilty and will end on the guillotine!
$FAB_020_OnGuilty_01
He is not worthy of the uniform!
$FAB_020_OnGuilty_02
Bring him here, I’ll sort the bastard out!
$FAB_020_OnNotGuilty_00
We should not kill the boy. Let him go.
$FAB_020_OnNotGuilty_01
And leave me to live in disgrace?
$FAB_020_OnNotGuilty_02
But he was the one who fired the gun!
$FAB_020_OnNotGuilty_03
So now they’re letting murderers walk free?
$FAB_020_01x02_00_QTitle
What happened?
$FAB_020_01x02_00_00
What happened?
$FAB_020_01x02_00_01
Did you not see the wound in his chest?
$FAB_020_01x02_00_02
Rather, what happened before the murder?
$FAB_020_01x02_00_03
I came to my father, who… had more important things on his mind than his own bastard.
$FAB_020_01x02_00_04
What was the tone of the conversation?
$FAB_020_01x02_00_05
It was cold. No… I think it is better to say icy. My father had a grudge against me.
$FAB_020_01x02_00_06
Why?
$FAB_020_01x02_00_07
Because I had turned to others with my problems, and that caused him trouble. He had just started a new chapter in his career…
$FAB_020_01x02_00_08
When did the shooting take place?
$FAB_020_01x02_00_09
After a short conversation. It was fast. To me, he became nothing more than a piece of meat, and no different than an enemy on the front. How else could one treat a father that regards his son with such contempt?
$FAB_020_01x04_01_QTitle
Why did you reload the weapon?
$FAB_020_01x04_01_00
Why did you reload the weapon?
$FAB_020_01x04_01_01
I decided it was no longer necessary for me to continue with my life.
$FAB_020_01x04_01_02
That is obvious, you committed a terrible crime.
$FAB_020_01x04_01_03
Not for that reason. My mother will die soon, my father lay dead before me, I will probably be guillotined for shooting him–
$FAB_020_01x04_01_04
You will.
$FAB_020_01x04_01_05
And even if I was released, I would be finished as a military officer. The court would pass its sentence, and then my commanding officers would pass their own.
$FAB_020_01x04_01_06
That would be against the law.
$FAB_020_01x04_01_07
I can see that you have not been in the Army, Citizen. But however it is viewed, my suicide would have been regarded as an honourable end to the affair. That is what I think.
$FAB_020_03x05_02_QTitle
Why did you keep silent in the cell when the guards asked you questions?
$FAB_020_03x05_02_00
Why did you keep silent in the cell when the guards asked you questions?
$FAB_020_03x05_02_01
Because all of a sudden many important figures became interested in me. I was visited by Citizen Hébert, then later Hanriot came in with the guards.
$FAB_020_03x05_02_02
What does that have to do with anything?
$FAB_020_03x05_02_03
Each of them asked if my father had told me something unusual before my death, anything that shocked or frightened me.
$FAB_020_03x05_02_04
And did he?
$FAB_020_03x05_02_05
The Revolution is not yet over and you can only promise me, monsieur le juge, that you will take care of my mother.
$FAB_020_03x05_02_07
It is not up to judges of this Tribunal to make promises of that kind. Tell me where she is, and her homeland will take care of her.
$FAB_020_03x05_02_08
…
$FAB_020_03x05_02_09
Do not say, then. As you wish.
$FAB_020_03x06_03_QTitle
Tell me about the assault on you.
$FAB_020_03x06_03_00
Tell me about the assault on you.
$FAB_020_03x06_03_01
They tried to interrogate me and I kept silent. Citizen Hanriot asked me questions and I still kept silent. Then they all left.
$FAB_020_03x06_03_02
Please get to the details.
$FAB_020_03x06_03_03
A few minutes later, a guard came in and introduced himself by punching me in the face. Then he asked questions, just like the others.
$FAB_020_03x06_03_04
What questions?
$FAB_020_03x06_03_05
Mainly whether my father had said anything about Robespierre or Hanriot.
$FAB_020_03x06_03_06
Why about those two?
$FAB_020_03x06_03_07
I guess they could tell you more about it than me.
$FAB_020_03x06_03_08
What happened next?
$FAB_020_03x06_03_09
The other guards came in and took him away. I think it is obvious that Citizen Hanriot really wanted to find out if I knew anything.
$FAB_020_03x07_04_QTitle
Summon the witness.
$FAB_020_03x07_04_00
Summon the witness.
$FAB_020_03x07_04_02
Please introduce yourself.
$FAB_020_03x07_04_03
In case anyone here has not recognised me, my name is François Hanriot and I am Commander-in-Chief of the National Guard.
$FAB_020_04x07_05_QTitle
Please explain the rumours of you being the archbishop’s son.
$FAB_020_04x07_05_00
Please explain the rumours of you being the archbishop’s son.
$FAB_020_04x07_05_01
What rumours? Everyone knows the truth by now anyway. Do you want me to exaggerate it and present some dramatic details so the cattle can have some fun?
$FAB_020_04x07_05_02
We’re not animals!
$FAB_020_04x07_05_03
Why did you not tell the truth when these revelations were disclosed?
$FAB_020_04x07_05_04
I swore to my mother. That was the only reason I needed.
$FAB_020_04x07_05_05
Did you want to take the secret with you to the grave?
$FAB_020_04x07_05_06
That would have been best. A family’s secrets should not be discussed and mocked by outsiders.
$FAB_020_04x07_05_07
Are you talking about us again?
$FAB_020_04x07_05_08
Will you not defend yourself?
$FAB_020_04x07_05_09
I already have. By shooting my father, I defended both my own honour and that of my mother. Now I will die with dignity.
$FAB_020_04x06_06_QTitle
How could you squander your military career so easily?
$FAB_020_04x06_06_00
How could you squander your military career so easily?
$FAB_020_04x06_06_01
How could I serve my nation while living with the knowledge that I have been disgraced?
$FAB_020_04x06_06_02
Are you referring to the rumours?
$FAB_020_04x06_06_03
I am referring to my father, who had not once even hugged his son. I am referring to my mother who is dying, waiting for the love of her past!
$FAB_020_04x06_06_04
And this is more important to you than your life and your service to the nation?
$FAB_020_04x06_06_05
Are you saying, monsieur le juge, that something can be more important than one’s family?
$FAB_020_04x06_06_06
The nation!
$FAB_020_04x06_06_07
The guillotine!
$FAB_020_04x06_06_08
Perhaps that is why I would rather die than live among you, among the people who have created this sick world… And all the more so since my family has been used for dirty political games.
$FAB_020_WIT_00_A_QTitle
How did you come to be at the scene of the crime?
$FAB_020_WIT_00_A_00
How did you come to be at the scene of the crime?
$FAB_020_WIT_00_A_01
Several people came to the station, shouting about a crime in Gobel’s house. As I was nearby, I decided to attend to it myself.
$FAB_020_WIT_00_A_02
You happened to be nearby?
$FAB_020_WIT_00_A_03
A coincidence. They do happen from time to time.
$FAB_020_WIT_00_A_04
Did you arrive there quickly?
$FAB_020_WIT_00_A_05
I do not know how many minutes had passed, but I was there soon after the Guards.
$FAB_020_WIT_00_B_QTitle
How were you able to convince the defendant to surrender?
$FAB_020_WIT_00_B_00
How were you able to convince the defendant to surrender?
$FAB_020_WIT_00_B_01
We had a long talk.
$FAB_020_WIT_00_B_02
About what?
$FAB_020_WIT_00_B_03
I told him that dishonouring the military uniform by killing himself was a greater crime than what he had done to Gobel.
$FAB_020_WIT_00_B_04
And that convinced him?
$FAB_020_WIT_00_B_05
He is an officer. You have never worn a uniform, so you would not understand it, but he has deep respect for the Army. Yes, that convinced him.
$FAB_020_WIT_01_A_QTitle
Did you send in the guard who attacked the defendant?
$FAB_020_WIT_01_A_00
Did you send in the guard who attacked the defendant?
$FAB_020_WIT_01_A_01
Do not be ridiculous. The man was acting independently, and he will be punished for it.
$FAB_020_WIT_01_A_02
How?
$FAB_020_WIT_01_A_03
I have not decided yet, but it is interesting that you are more concerned about a hot-tempered guard than a murderer…
$FAB_020_WIT_01_A_04
You can stop with your insinuations. Has any guard ever shown such insubordination before?
$FAB_020_WIT_01_A_05
No, never. Things like that do not happen under my command.
$FAB_020_WIT_01_A_06
And yet he did it just when a prisoner could have information concerning yourself that he should not have had?
$FAB_020_WIT_01_A_07
I will not comment upon such absurdity.
$FAB_020_WIT_01_B_QTitle
What dealings do you have with Citizen Robespierre?
$FAB_020_WIT_01_B_00
What dealings do you have with Citizen Robespierre?
$FAB_020_WIT_01_B_01
None, in fact. We only communicated by letter once – he sent me congratulations after I was appointed commander-in-chief of the National Guard.
$FAB_020_WIT_01_B_02
Nevertheless, your subordinate asked about him while kicking the defendant. From all the things he could possibly ask, he was only concerned with what the defendant knew about Robespierre?
$FAB_020_WIT_01_B_03
I cannot explain it. Has he told you anything?
$FAB_020_WIT_01_B_04
And if he has?
$FAB_020_WIT_01_B_05
I was asking out of curiosity. But if he has not, then it would seem to me the guard must have been wrong to think that Gérard Boutin had obtained adverse information.
