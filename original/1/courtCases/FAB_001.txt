Claude Pochard, a 26-year-old <a name="1" class="hidden">vicar</a> and tutor. Son of a cobbler. Believes in Enlightenment ideals. After refusing to adjure the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, he was removed from his parish, prohibited from carrying out his duties, and sentenced to <a name="2" class="hidden">banishment</a>. Despite this, he stayed in Paris and continued his work as a <a name="3" class="hidden">tutor</a>, which he started before 1789.
$FAB_001_DOC_1_01
Pochard was captured in the streets by fortuitous circumstance. A guard officer present during his trial a few months ago recognised him and didn’t hesitate to act… Following an investigation, Pochard was accused of <a name="4" class="hidden">spying</a> and <a name="5" class="hidden">spreading Counter-Revolutionary propaganda</a> in order to prepare a foreign intervention that would end the Revolution.
$FAB_001_DOC_1_02
Correspondence with Archbishop Jean-Arsen de Breteuil was found in a room Pochard had been renting from Marie Gimet. In it, the clergyman asked for information about the unrest and the supporters of the monarchy in hiding. <a name="6" class="hidden">Riches</a> were also found – a golden chalice and a reliquary.
$FAB_001_DOC_1_03
Moreover, the director of one of the orphanages Claude taught in testified that the tutor would question the law of the Revolution in front of the students, stating that it was less important than the laws handed down by God.

A letter from the archbishop
$FAB_001_DOC_2_00
	Dear Claude,

	Remember to stay strong in your faith and complete your duties with dignity. Tell me how our brothers in faith are doing, as well as the Church in these desperate times. 
	
May God protect you, 
Jean-Arsen

$FAB_001_OnStart_00
Please introduce yourself.
$FAB_001_OnStart_01
Monsieur le juge, you know me…
$FAB_001_OnStart_02
State your personal information or there will be consequences!
$FAB_001_OnStart_03
Claude Pochard, monsieur le juge.
$FAB_001_OnStart_04
You stand accused of spying for the Counter-Revolutionaries and criticising the existing order. Do you admit to these crimes?
$FAB_001_OnStart_05
I am innocent! The accusation is exaggerated and comes from the ill will of the accusers.
$FAB_001_OnStart_06
Suggesting that the Revolutionary government is acting in ill will – typical of a priest.
$FAB_001_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Claude Pochard to be guillotined! Lead the condemned out.
$FAB_001_OnGuilty_01
Monsieur le juge, your bravery is admirable!
$FAB_001_OnGuilty_02
Yes, take him away!
$FAB_001_OnGuilty_03
Let the guillotine drink his blood!
$FAB_001_OnPrison_00
I sentence Citizen Claude Pochard to prison! Lead the condemned out.
$FAB_001_OnPrison_01
He saved that priest!
$FAB_001_OnPrison_02
He showed mercy to an enemy of the Revolution!
$FAB_001_OnPrison_03
He ought to have been killed. I have nothing else to say.
$FAB_001_OnNotGuilty_00
The judgement for Claude Pochard is… not guilty! Take the defendant away.
$FAB_001_OnNotGuilty_01
Are you mad?!
$FAB_001_OnNotGuilty_02
You should both be killed!
$FAB_001_OnNotGuilty_03
How can you set an agent of the Pope free?
$FAB_001_02x04_00_QTitle
Why did the accused stay in France despite being banished?
$FAB_001_02x04_00_00
Why did the accused stay in France despite being banished?
$FAB_001_02x04_00_01
I had to take care of my sick mother. Without me, she would surely have died.
$FAB_001_02x04_00_02
Why did you not take her with you?
$FAB_001_02x04_00_03
Good, make the filth squirm!
$FAB_001_02x04_00_04
I was in no position to afford that. I am just a poor parish priest who is unable to even carry out his duties. I have to teach every single day to survive.
$FAB_001_02x04_00_05
Is that why you started spying? For money?
$FAB_001_02x04_00_06
No. What information could I glean that would be useful to émigrés?
$FAB_001_02x04_00_07
That of the supposed persecution of priests. The main argument that Archbishop de Breteuil and Pius VI are using to convince Catholic monarchs to strike against the Revolution.
$FAB_001_02x04_00_08
I do not correspond with émigrés, and I certainly do not write about the suffering of our clergymen.
$FAB_001_02x04_00_09
I would like to remind you that we have evidence.
$FAB_001_02x04_00_10
Away with the liar!
$FAB_001_03x04_01_QTitle
The accused travels extensively around the Paris Department. To what end?
$FAB_001_03x04_01_00
The accused travels extensively around the Paris Department. To what end?
$FAB_001_03x04_01_01
I teach wherever I can find students. Doing that requires time and effort, I admit.
$FAB_001_03x04_01_02
Is that why you received gold from your fellow conspirators abroad?
$FAB_001_03x04_01_03
He travels around France to spy on people.
$FAB_001_03x04_01_04
The only money I see comes from my students’ caregivers – it is not at all immodest.
$FAB_001_03x04_01_05
So where did the riches found in your room come from?
$FAB_001_03x04_01_06
They were liturgical accoutrements. I saved them from the plunder of the church in Compans. I would rather go hungry than sell them!
$FAB_001_03x04_01_07
Fanatic! Thief!
$FAB_001_03x04_01_08
Peddler of superstition!
$FAB_001_05x07_02_QTitle
What do you teach?
$FAB_001_05x07_02_00
What do you teach?
$FAB_001_05x07_02_01
The caregivers in orphanages only pay for reading and writing lessons.
$FAB_001_05x07_02_02
So why did the accused teach children that God’s law stands above that of the Republic? You spread superstition and Counter-Revolutionary propaganda.
$FAB_001_05x07_02_03
This is a misunderstanding. The children I teach are unable to understand such complicated matters.
$FAB_001_05x07_02_04
The accused’s explanation further incriminates him. If they are unable to understand the topic, why would he even discuss it at all?
$FAB_001_05x07_02_05
The Church spreads ignorance and takes our money.
$FAB_001_05x07_02_06
I was only answering questions from the director of the orphanage in Gombiens. I said that God’s law stood above my banishment. It is God’s law that prohibits me from leaving the country. I have a duty to help those in need.
$FAB_001_04x08_03_QTitle
What information did the accused manage to convey to Archbishop de Breteuil?
$FAB_001_04x08_03_00
What information did the accused manage to convey to Archbishop de Breteuil?
$FAB_001_04x08_03_01
None. I have no connection with the archbishop. Why would he be interested in a parish priest’s help?
$FAB_001_04x08_03_02
What about your letter? We have it in our files! You received instructions from the archbishop!
$FAB_001_04x08_03_03
Pope’s dog!
$FAB_001_04x08_03_04
Behead the traitor!
$FAB_001_04x08_03_05
It is a simple letter, not instructions – and it is not from the archbishop, but from my parish priest in Compans, Jean-Arsène Cerreto.
$FAB_001_04x08_03_06
Where is he now?
$FAB_001_04x08_03_07
I know only that he planned to leave for Switzerland. He may have changed his mind. That is why I never thought to respond to the letter.
$FAB_001_04x08_03_08
What a coincidence – Archbishop de Breteuil currently resides in Switzerland.
$FAB_001_04x08_03_09
It is indeed a coincidence. Many clergymen reside in Switzerland.
$FAB_001_04x08_03_10
Who believes that?
$FAB_001_02x05_04_QTitle
Summon the witness Marie Gimet.
$FAB_001_02x05_04_00
Summon the witness Marie Gimet.
$FAB_001_02x05_04_02
Citizen, what is your name?
$FAB_001_02x05_04_03
Marie Gimet, monsieur le juge.
$FAB_001_03x06_05_QTitle
What stipend does the accused receive as a teacher?
$FAB_001_03x06_05_00
What stipend does the accused receive as a teacher?
$FAB_001_03x06_05_01
Two francs a week, but most people give me food instead: bread, butter, sometimes wine.
$FAB_001_03x06_05_02
Does it not bother you that poor people have to take food from their children to give it to you?
$FAB_001_03x06_05_06
Of course it bothers me, but I too have to eat.
$FAB_001_03x06_05_03
He keeps gold under his bed and still takes food from the poor!
$FAB_001_03x06_05_04
We demand an explanation: where does the gold come from? Is it not from your fellow conspirators abroad?
$FAB_001_03x06_05_05
Of course not. It belongs to the parish in Compans, which is currently under my care. This gold is not my property.
$FAB_001_02x03_06_QTitle
Why did the accused continue teaching instead of leaving France?
$FAB_001_02x03_06_00
Why did the accused continue teaching instead of leaving France?
$FAB_001_02x03_06_01
My duty is to help others. If I am unable to help as a priest, I want to at least share some of my knowledge.
$FAB_001_02x03_06_02
Your knowledge is Catholic propaganda.
$FAB_001_02x03_06_03
I prefer the term “Catholic values”.
$FAB_001_01x06_07_QTitle
Did the accused celebrate Masses despite the ban?
$FAB_001_01x06_07_00
Did the accused celebrate Masses despite the ban?
$FAB_001_01x06_07_01
There are no churches where I could do that.
$FAB_001_01x06_07_02
Then what purpose do the chalice and reliquary possessed by the accused serve?
$FAB_001_01x06_07_03
Private religious practice.
$FAB_001_01x06_07_04
You were prohibited from administering sacraments.
$FAB_001_01x06_07_05
It is not sacrament, merely prayer. The Declaration of the Rights of the Man and of the Citizen allows me to pray. You should be familiar with the document.
$FAB_001_01x06_07_06
That is beside the point – by promoting superstitions in a progressive country, you are spreading sedition!
$FAB_001_WIT_00_A_QTitle
Was the witness aware that she was renting a room to an unsworn Catholic priest?
$FAB_001_WIT_00_A_00
Was the witness aware that she was renting a room to an unsworn Catholic priest?
$FAB_001_WIT_00_A_01
You had better tell the truth, or we will deal with you next.
$FAB_001_WIT_00_A_02
Do not intimidate the witness. Please do tell us, Citizen.
$FAB_001_WIT_00_A_03
I didn’t know he was a priest. He never wore a cassock, so how was I supposed to know? He wanted a room, I gave him a room.
$FAB_001_WIT_00_A_04
So he hid that fact from you?
$FAB_001_WIT_00_A_05
He dressed normally, so maybe he did. I don’t know.
$FAB_001_WIT_00_B_QTitle
Did the accused maintain extensive correspondence?
$FAB_001_WIT_00_B_00
Did the accused maintain extensive correspondence?
$FAB_001_WIT_00_B_01
Meaning?
$FAB_001_WIT_00_B_02
Did he receive many letters?
$FAB_001_WIT_00_B_03
I don’t remember any letters with his name.
$FAB_001_WIT_00_B_04
Perhaps he had a rich social life? Did he entertain many guests?
$FAB_001_WIT_00_B_05
I don’t remember anybody visiting him at all. He wasn’t there most of the time anyway. He just used the room to sleep.
$FAB_001_WIT_00_B_06
Where would he go?
$FAB_001_WIT_00_B_07
I don’t ask my guests about things like that.
$FAB_001_WIT_01_A_QTitle
Did he pay rent on time?
$FAB_001_WIT_01_A_00
Did he pay rent on time?
$FAB_001_WIT_01_A_01
Sometimes I had to threaten to kick him out. But eventually, he would always pay.
$FAB_001_WIT_01_A_02
So the accused did not strike you as a person who has a substantial amount of money to operate with or spend freely?
$FAB_001_WIT_01_A_03
No, he lived like a poor man. I mean, a normal fellow would never get rich from teaching.
$FAB_001_WIT_01_B_QTitle
Did he ever criticise the Revolution and its accomplishments?
$FAB_001_WIT_01_B_00
Did he ever criticise the Revolution and its accomplishments?
$FAB_001_WIT_01_B_01
Once he said that instead of beheading, they could do something about economy and teaching. That the children are hungry and… well, can’t read or write.
$FAB_001_WIT_01_B_02
Did he ever question the law?
$FAB_001_WIT_01_B_03
Now that I think about it, maybe he did. One evening, he complained that the law didn’t work. That a smart person would send all the kids to school – by force if need be!
$FAB_001_WIT_01_B_04
Priests lectured our nation for a thousand years and nothing good came out of it.
$FAB_001_WIT_01_B_05
He’s right!
$FAB_001_WIT_01_B_06
They gave us nothing more than hunger and disease!
$FAB_001_WIT_01_B_08
What does the accused have to say?
$FAB_001_WIT_01_B_09
Just what Madame Gimet said. I only want a decent and universal education for the youngest. Is that really criticising the Revolution? One of its slogans is equality!

A letter from the archbishop
$FAB_001_precourt_00
The mob wanted to act as both judge and jury again and hang people from the street lamps. Poor Pochard was almost hanged…
$FAB_001_precourt_01
Pochard? Claude Pochard?
$FAB_001_precourt_02
Exactly. The beloved tutor of your Frédéric. You had to dismiss him after the incident with the oath of the clergy, did you not?
$FAB_001_precourt_03
Yes. Frédéric tells me from time to time that he misses his teacher…
$FAB_001_precourt_04
What are you doing? The trial is about to begin.
$FAB_001_precourt_05
It’s about Monsieur Pochard…
$FAB_001_precourt_06
News travels fast… He’s been accused of Counter-Revolutionary activities.
$FAB_001_precourt_07
You know him. It can’t be true.
$FAB_001_precourt_08
It’s not so simple. Leave, before somebody hears us.
$FAB_001_precourt_09
Papa… Please…
$FAB_001_precourt_10
Go home!
$FAB_001_precourt_11
Think about the family, for once at least.
$FAB_001_precourt_12
Papa…
$FAB_001_LastDialog_01
I’ve always been loyal to the common folk. To the Citizens.
$FAB_001_LastDialog_02
