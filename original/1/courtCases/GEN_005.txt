Before the court stands Claude Garnier, a resident of Paris and a baker’s apprentice, arrested for robbery. He led a group of people who <a name="1" class="hidden">broke into</a> the house of Citizen Dominique Fournier, a wealthy man. According to Fournier’s testimony, the robbers insulted him and then began <a name="2" class="hidden">beating him</a>.
$GEN_005_DOC_01_01
At the same time, Claude Garnier told his accomplices which expensive belongings should be taken and the group left the battered Fournier lying on the floor. Many witnesses saw the whole incident. <a name="4" class="hidden">Fournier’s servant</a> saw present during the events, while some passers-by looked through the windows.
$GEN_005_DOC_01_02
Garnier not only admitted to leading the group, but he actually boasted about it, calling it a Revolutionary deed of which he was proud. He supposedly found out that Fournier <a name="5" class="hidden">is funding</a> Counter-Revolutionary leaflets and decided to relieve him of his funds.
$GEN_005_DOC_01_03
The accused would not reveal the source of that information. He handed the Guards <a name="9" class="hidden">a lampoon of Robespierre</a>, claiming that he had found a thick pile of them in the victim’s house. Garnier claimed to having burned all but one, which he kept as evidence. When the Guards arrested him, they noticed a <a name="8" class="hidden">gold signet ring</a> on his finger that belonged to Citizen Fournier.
$GEN_005_DOC_01_04
Garnier often takes a stand during the gatherings of the Enragés, demanding that all wealthy people be hanged. In the year 1789, he took part in <a name="6" class="hidden">the storming of the Bastille</a>.

<h1>Dominique Fournier</h1>
Dominique Fournier
Fournier is a financier. It is a well-known fact that he was a strong supporter of Finance Minister Necker right to the end of his career. We have established and confirmed with many people that he followed the Girondins, although he has not taken an active role in public life in recent years. It is also a fact that after the robbery, Fournier’s house was thoroughly searched and no Counter-Revolutionary materials were found there.
$GEN_005_OnStart_00
We need more people like Garnier!
$GEN_005_OnStart_01
Please introduce yourself.
$GEN_005_OnStart_02
My name is Claude Garnier.
$GEN_005_OnStart_03
You are accused of breaking into the house of Citizen Fournier, whom you then brutally assaulted and robbed.
$GEN_005_OnStart_04
I led an investigation of his house. Vive la Révolution!
$GEN_005_OnStart_05
Good!
$GEN_005_OnStart_06
Who gave you the right to represent the Revolution?
$GEN_005_OnStart_07
The people of Paris!
$GEN_005_OnStart_08
Sure we did!
$GEN_005_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Citizen Claude Garnier to be guillotined! Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_005_OnGuilty_01
A brave decision. I am glad that it was not me who had to make it.
$GEN_005_OnGuilty_02
Outrageous!
$GEN_005_OnPrison_00
I sentence Citizen Claude Garnier to prison! Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_005_OnPrison_01
What?!
$GEN_005_OnNotGuilty_00
The judgement is… not guilty! Set Citizen Garnier free.
$GEN_005_OnNotGuilty_01
Superb!
$GEN_005_OnNotGuilty_02
Very wise and just.
$GEN_005_OnNotGuilty_03
Vive la Révolution!
$GEN_005_OnNotGuilty_04
I see that you want to impress the people.
$GEN_005_01x02_00_QTitle
Citizen Fournier was severely beaten.
$GEN_005_01x02_00_00
Citizen Fournier was severely beaten.
$GEN_005_01x02_00_01
He could have avoided it. Yes, I punched him once or twice, but only because he kept squealing like a pig.
$GEN_005_01x02_00_02
Are you proud of yourself?
$GEN_005_01x02_00_03
He got what he deserved.
$GEN_005_01x02_00_04
Royalists are animals!
$GEN_005_01x02_00_05
He “kept squealing” when you were turning his place over?
$GEN_005_01x02_00_06
He was plotting against decent Parisians. Isn’t that enough?
$GEN_005_01x02_00_07
We’ll kill that hog!
$GEN_005_01x03_01_QTitle
You are saying that the whole deed was supposed to serve the ideals of the Revolution.
$GEN_005_01x03_01_00
You are saying that the whole deed was supposed to serve the ideals of the Revolution. Have Robespierre or Danton ever encouraged their followers to become robbers?
$GEN_005_01x03_01_01
Not robbers, no, soldiers of the Revolution. I confiscated goods that were serving a rotten cause. If I wasn’t arrested, I’d have handed everything to the authorities.
$GEN_005_01x03_01_02
You did not do so immediately after the robbery?
$GEN_005_01x03_01_03
I think we had the right to celebrate avenging all the wrongs we had to suffer.
$GEN_005_01x03_01_04
What wrongs did you have in mind?
$GEN_005_01x03_01_05
My whole life I worked my fingers to the bone while Fournier, and others like him, were sat around getting fatter.
$GEN_005_01x03_01_06
Wise words, wealth for the people!
$GEN_005_01x06_02_QTitle
Did you really take part in the storming of the Bastille?
$GEN_005_01x06_02_00
Did you really take part in the storming of the Bastille?
$GEN_005_01x06_02_01
I did.
$GEN_005_01x06_02_02
What a hero! One of us!
$GEN_005_01x06_02_03
Was your experience helpful? The only thing missing was de Launay’s head raised on a pike.
$GEN_005_01x06_02_04
That’s another difference – I wasn’t arrested for doing it. Everyone knew that we were doing the right thing.
$GEN_005_01x06_02_05
The Bastille was a fortress. We are talking about breaking into the house of an unarmed man, and that is why we have doubts.
$GEN_005_01x06_02_06
You mean an unarmed Royalist pig.
$GEN_005_02x04_03_QTitle
Call in the witness, the victim’s servant, Gaëtan Calvet.
$GEN_005_02x04_03_00
Call in the witness, the victim’s servant, Gaëtan Calvet.
$GEN_005_03x08_04_QTitle
You were found with a gold signet, Citizen.
$GEN_005_03x08_04_00
You were found with a gold signet, Citizen. I have reason to believe that it belonged to the victim. Am I right?
$GEN_005_03x08_04_01
Why do you all keep calling him a “victim”. He’s a rich traitor! The true victims are the people of France!
$GEN_005_03x08_04_02
You know what we are talking about, and we will take care of him in due course. Now, what about that signet?
$GEN_005_03x08_04_03
Ah, the signet… Nice, isn’t it? Those swines got fat off our hard work, and they refused to give us a tiny part of their wealth. Not even the tiniest.
$GEN_005_03x08_04_04
Huzzah!
$GEN_005_03x08_04_05
What did you plan to do with it?
$GEN_005_03x08_04_06
Nothing. It looked nice on my finger. Much better than on that pig.
$GEN_005_03x08_04_07
The signet was not the only thing you took, was it? I heard the house was stripped of everything precious.
$GEN_005_03x08_04_08
I was especially fond of those gold-plated candlesticks…
$GEN_005_05x07_05_QTitle
Why would you think that the victim had anything to do with…?
$GEN_005_05x07_05_00
Why would you think that the victim had anything to do with Counter-Revolutionary activity?
$GEN_005_05x07_05_01
Ask anyone on the street, they all knew about it. Only no one had any proof and we were tired of waiting.
$GEN_005_05x07_05_02
How did they know? Did the rats talk to them?
$GEN_005_05x07_05_03
Well, they just knew. The people always know what’s going on!
$GEN_005_05x07_05_04
We always smell a filthy Royalist!
$GEN_005_05x07_05_05
So you decided to find evidence of Fournier’s guilt?
$GEN_005_05x07_05_06
Whenever someone’s suspected of a crime, there’s an investigation, no? We decided to do one.
$GEN_005_05x07_05_07
Do I understand correctly that you assaulted Citizen Fournier because of some rumours?
$GEN_005_05x07_05_08
Monsieur le juge, are you implying that Parisians are liars?
$GEN_005_05x07_05_09
I am the one who asks questions here, not you.
$GEN_005_05x07_05_10
The judge is on the side of the bourgeoisie!
$GEN_005_05x09_06_QTitle
After you were arrested, you handed the Guards a slanderous leaflet…
$GEN_005_05x09_06_00
After you were arrested, you handed the Guards a slanderous leaflet about Citizen Robespierre.
$GEN_005_05x09_06_01
I found it in the Royalist pig’s house. There were scores of them there and we burned them all in the street.
$GEN_005_05x09_06_02
Wonderful!
$GEN_005_05x09_06_03
You did not burn that one.
$GEN_005_05x09_06_04
I saved it, just in case.
$GEN_005_05x09_06_05
How can we be sure it belonged to Fournier?
$GEN_005_05x09_06_06
Where else would I find it?
$GEN_005_05x09_06_07
Tell us exactly where you found it.
$GEN_005_05x09_06_08
He had piles of these leaflets in a recess there.
$GEN_005_05x09_06_09
Plotter!
$GEN_005_05x09_06_10
Scum!
$GEN_005_05x09_06_11
Why did you not go to the Guard with the leaflet at once?
$GEN_005_05x09_06_12
Why would I?
$GEN_005_05x09_06_13
With evidence like that, you could be sure the accused would meet the guillotine.
$GEN_005_05x09_06_14
…
$GEN_005_05x09_06_15
He’s right! You should’ve brought the leaflet to the Guard!
$GEN_005_WIT_00_A_QTitle
Do you work for the victim?
$GEN_005_WIT_00_A_00
Do you work for the victim?
$GEN_005_WIT_00_A_01
Yes, monsieur le juge, that’s right.
$GEN_005_WIT_00_A_02
Did you see the atta–
$GEN_005_WIT_00_A_03
I saw everything! They beat him, hitting and kicking–
$GEN_005_WIT_00_A_04
May I finish the sentence?
$GEN_005_WIT_00_A_05
Then one of them wanted to hit him with a wooden bat. I started screaming, and you know what that thug did? He started laughing. He found it awfully funny…
$GEN_005_WIT_00_A_06
Did you see the defendant among the assailants?
$GEN_005_WIT_00_A_07
He conducted them like an orchestra! First the strings – snip! Then the percussion – bam!
$GEN_005_WIT_00_A_08
Enough with the metaphor.
$GEN_005_WIT_00_B_QTitle
Why did you not try to interrupt or defend the victim?
$GEN_005_WIT_00_B_00
Why did you not try to interrupt or defend the victim?
$GEN_005_WIT_00_B_01
Me?
$GEN_005_WIT_00_B_02
Yes.
$GEN_005_WIT_00_B_03
I only serve wine. What chance would I have against a group of thugs?
$GEN_005_WIT_00_B_04
Did they attack you as well?
$GEN_005_WIT_00_B_05
Fortunately, they didn’t.
$GEN_005_WIT_00_B_06
It is clear that their aim was the bourgeoisie and not the common people. Did you call for help?
$GEN_005_WIT_00_B_07
I yelled, but nobody came.
