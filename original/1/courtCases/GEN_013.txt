Some time has passed since the liquidation of the widely hated <a name="1" class="hidden">Ferme générale</a>. The institution paid duties to the former King, and then, often brutally, collected liabilities from the people – usually with considerable interest. Now the National Convention has made the just decision to try all former fermier général who collected taxes from farmers. We will present the evidence against one of them – Antoine Lavoisier.
$GEN_013_DOC_01_01
The very first evidence of his guilt is the sheer fact that he earned his post through nepotism. Aside from collecting taxes from starving peasants, he was also involved in <a name="3" class="hidden">all manner of businesses</a>, and not always honest ones. Several witnesses have claimed that he was frequently trading in damp tobacco, sold at exorbitant prices. We have not found any indication of this aforementioned <a name="4" class="hidden">adulteration</a> in Lavoisier’s documents, but it is a topic widely discussed on the streets of Paris.
$GEN_013_DOC_01_02
He used money from the taxes to finance his private laboratory, where he carried out many chemical experiments. Many Parisian chemists that were approached during the investigation called Lavoisier <a name="5" class="hidden">a brilliant scientist</a>.
$GEN_013_DOC_01_03
Of course, this alone does not mean treason. However, the accused frequently corresponded with <a name="6" class="hidden">foreign scientists</a>. We have established that he supported them with the money taken from French peasants, and it is possible that he was also sharing the results of his <a name="7" class="hidden">research</a>. Why not keep it all for the French people?

<a name="8" class="hidden">Report</a> regarding tobacco:
$GEN_013_DOC_02_01
I kindly ask you to keep the tobacco in a dry place. Damp tobacco keeps the customers away, decreases its quality, and lowers its price. Regards, Antoine Lavoisier
$GEN_013_OnStart_00
Yes! Punish those filthy leeches!
$GEN_013_OnStart_01
Those people simply must be decapitated. They symbolise everything the common Frenchman revolted against.
$GEN_013_OnStart_02
Please introduce yourself.
$GEN_013_OnStart_03
My name is Antoine Lavoisier.
$GEN_013_OnStart_04
What is your occupation, Mr Lavoisier?
$GEN_013_OnStart_05
I aided tax collection in the Ferme générale, and I am also a scientist. Allow me to add immodestly that I have made a number of very important discoveries.
$GEN_013_OnStart_06
Do not boast before the court.
$GEN_013_OnStart_07
Sure, tell us how you ate pâté bought with our money.
$GEN_013_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Citizen Antoine Lavoisier to death by guillotine. Take him away.
$GEN_013_OnGuilty_01
All the enemies of France will share his fate.
$GEN_013_OnGuilty_02
Huzzah!
$GEN_013_OnGuilty_03
Get rid of those leeches!
$GEN_013_OnGuilty_04
Let’s cure France!
$GEN_013_OnPrison_00
For his crimes, Antoine Lavoisier is sentenced to prison. Take the convict away.
$GEN_013_OnPrison_01
That verdict is far too lenient for such a profound enemy of the Republic.
$GEN_013_OnPrison_02
Only prison? For a traitor like him?
$GEN_013_OnPrison_03
Impossible!
$GEN_013_OnPrison_04
What kind of punishment is that?!
$GEN_013_OnNotGuilty_00
I hereby declare the defendant not guilty. Lead Mr Lavoisier out.
$GEN_013_OnNotGuilty_01
The Judge has lost his mind!
$GEN_013_OnNotGuilty_02
Justice will be served anyway!
$GEN_013_OnNotGuilty_03
You just spat in the faces of thousands of farmers.
$GEN_013_01x03_00_QTitle
Aside from your position at the Ferme générale and your scientific works…
$GEN_013_01x03_00_00
Aside from your position at the Ferme générale and your scientific works, do you have any other occupations?
$GEN_013_01x03_00_01
I am also a member of the Gunpowder Commission, and before the beginning of the Revolution I was assigned to officiate the administrative council of the Caisse d’escompte.
$GEN_013_01x03_00_02
Do you not think that is a lot for just one person?
$GEN_013_01x03_00_03
Greedy fraud!
$GEN_013_01x03_00_04
The people who assigned me to those positions never once complained about the quality of my work.
$GEN_013_01x03_00_05
It must be a coincidence that most of those people have already been sentenced to prison or the guillotine.
$GEN_013_01x03_00_06
Someone is finally taking care of those thieving rogues!
$GEN_013_01x02_01_QTitle
How did you become a fermier général? There are so many rumours about it…
$GEN_013_01x02_01_00
How did you become a fermier général? There are so many rumours about it…
$GEN_013_01x02_01_01
I inherited the position from my father-in-law.
$GEN_013_01x02_01_02
Filthy nepotist!
$GEN_013_01x02_01_03
Why did you agree to take it?
$GEN_013_01x02_01_04
I was working for the King of France, for the whole state really. I was honoured by it. To be honest, I also enjoyed the work.
$GEN_013_01x02_01_05
You enjoy being rich!
$GEN_013_01x02_01_06
I think you married because you wanted your father-in-law to give you that position.
$GEN_013_01x02_01_07
What a revolting insinuation!
$GEN_013_01x02_01_08
The truth is that thanks to the marriage you started earning a lot more money than an average person.
$GEN_013_01x02_01_09
Marrying a wealthy woman is not a crime.
$GEN_013_01x02_01_10
How old was your wife when you married?
$GEN_013_01x02_01_11
Thirteen. I do not see how the age of my wife is relevant to the case.
$GEN_013_04x08_02_QTitle
You have been accused of swindles and deceits of all sorts. One of them is selling damp tobacco.
$GEN_013_04x08_02_00
You have been accused of swindles and deceits of all sorts. One of them is selling damp tobacco.
$GEN_013_04x08_02_01
Absurd! I have personally admonished my suppliers to make sure that the tobacco stays dry. Look through my papers, you will find the reports.
$GEN_013_04x08_02_02
You could have put those reports among other papers to deceive us.
$GEN_013_04x08_02_03
People like him are natural born liars!
$GEN_013_04x08_02_04
I have kept exemplary documentation, never once acting against my conscience.
$GEN_013_04x08_02_05
The conscience of a tax collector… I assume it did not stand in your way when you were taking money from starving farmers?
$GEN_013_04x08_02_06
I always acted according to French tax legislation.
$GEN_013_04x08_02_07
That law was dreadful!
$GEN_013_06x04_03_QTitle
Let us talk about the money you stole from the state treasury.
$GEN_013_06x04_03_00
Let us talk about the money you stole from the state treasury.
$GEN_013_06x04_03_01
What stolen money? What is the basis of this accusation?
$GEN_013_06x04_03_02
The money you were stealing from France was used to support foreign scientists. Why? We do not know…
$GEN_013_06x04_03_03
But we suspect it had something to do with war.
$GEN_013_06x04_03_04
I was financing foreign research, yes, but with my own money and it had nothing to do with war!
$GEN_013_06x04_03_05
You were acting against the best interests of the state. That is treason. Do you know what we do to traitors?
$GEN_013_06x04_03_06
Let me just say that it will take you only an instant to cut off this head, but one hundred years may not suffice to reproduce its like.
$GEN_013_06x04_03_07
The Republic has no need for scientists!
$GEN_013_05x07_04_QTitle
Did you keep your laboratory in operation by using the taxpayer’s money?
$GEN_013_05x07_04_00
Did you keep your laboratory in operation by using the taxpayer’s money?
$GEN_013_05x07_04_01
Yes, monsieur le juge.
$GEN_013_05x07_04_02
What exactly did you discover? Anything useful?
$GEN_013_05x07_04_03
I explained, among others, the phenomenon of combustion, disproved the phlogiston theory, constructed the calorimeter…
$GEN_013_05x07_04_04
What is he talking about?
$GEN_013_05x07_04_05
Do those discoveries help the regular Citizen?
$GEN_013_05x07_04_06
Science does not necessarily immediately help people, but one day those discoveries will…
$GEN_013_05x07_04_07
Did you hear that? Science doesn’t help people!
$GEN_013_05x07_04_08
How much money was spent on your research?
$GEN_013_05x07_04_09
I never measured it. I have been working on my discoveries for years.
$GEN_013_05x07_04_10
He didn’t measure it because we were paying.
$GEN_013_05x03_05_QTitle
Why did you not focus solely on science?
$GEN_013_05x03_05_00
Why did you not focus solely on science?
$GEN_013_05x03_05_01
I had enough time to engage in various activities.
$GEN_013_05x03_05_02
If you focused on one field you could be more efficient, don’t you think?
$GEN_013_05x03_05_03
Thank you for your concern, but my daily routine is my business.
$GEN_013_05x03_05_04
No, it is not. As a public official, you should spend all your time and energy on your work for the state. But you did not.
$GEN_013_05x03_05_05
What will that leech say now?
$GEN_013_05x03_05_06
Regular people have to focus on one task. For me, it is not enough. I would be bored to death.
$GEN_013_05x06_06_QTitle
Tell us more about the foreign scientists that asked for your help and financial support. Who were they?
$GEN_013_05x06_06_00
Tell us more about the foreign scientists that asked for your help and financial support. Who were they?
$GEN_013_05x06_06_01
Some of them were Italian chemists, great scientific minds, but not so talented when it comes to raising money. Bartolomeo Beccaria, Diego Petrarca, Daniele Marconi…
$GEN_013_05x06_06_02
You supported Italians, even though they have been at war with France so many times?
$GEN_013_05x06_06_03
That's right!
$GEN_013_05x06_06_04
We have fought with each and every one of our neighbours. What does that have to do with science?
$GEN_013_05x06_06_05
Was it not scientists like you who created the firearm – a object that completely changed the art of war?
$GEN_013_05x06_06_06
My work was not connected to weaponry.
