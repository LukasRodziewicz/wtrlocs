Speech for the prosecution by Antoine Quentin Fouquier-Tinville
$FAB_003_DOC_1_00
Compatriots!  Citizen Capet, previously known as King Louis XVI of France, must be punished for conspiring against the people of France!
$FAB_003_DOC_1_01
Louis Capet tried to <a name="1" class="hidden">defend his absolute authority</a> by plotting against the National Constituent Assembly and the people of France. We all remember July of 1789. He <a name="2" class="hidden">gathered an army</a>, 15 foreign regiments, and ordered them to <a name="3" class="hidden">surround Paris</a>. Soldiers led by Baron de Besenval were to capture deputies and shoot at Citizens defending the reforms! And so they did! The Royal German Regiment drew first blood!
$FAB_003_DOC_1_02
After the plot failed, Louis Capet <a name="4" class="hidden">tried to flee</a> the country with his family and <a name="5" class="hidden">scheme with foreign monarchs</a> abroad. Is that not the reason he took flight from the Tuileries one night in June of 1791 using <a name="6" class="hidden">someone else’s passport</a>? Was he not heading to Montmédy where his loyal armies were stationed, ready to take him to Austria? If it were not for <a name="7" class="hidden">Postmaster Douret</a>, this scheme could have ended tragically for us.
$FAB_003_DOC_1_03
Louis Capet will never abandon the thought of <a name="8" class="hidden">suppressing the Revolution by force</a>. Before the events of 1792, he gave orders for the Swiss Guard stationed in the Tuileries <a name="9" class="hidden">to be doubled</a>. He conducted a public muster in front of horrified Citizens. The people had no choice! They had to act before Capet attacked! Citizens of Paris who tried to stop the madness were <a name="11" class="hidden">shot at</a>, even after Capet’s escape to the National Assembly.

Evidence: An order issued by Marshal de Broglie to Baron de Besenval.

An order issued by Marshal de Broglie to Baron de Besenval
$FAB_003_DOC_2_00
My lord! Should any reason appear, shoot the rebels without hesitation, just as His Majesty ordered. Have no mercy, for they shall have none either. V.F. de Broglie
$FAB_003_OnStart_00
Louis Capet, I hereby open your trial. Answer the questions when asked.
$FAB_003_OnStart_01
Capet is the name of one of my ancestors. My name is Louis August de Bourbon.
$FAB_003_OnStart_02
That may have been your name before you raised your hand against the people you had sworn to defend.
$FAB_003_OnStart_03
As a King, I have never done a thing against my people. I loved them and I still do–
$FAB_003_OnStart_04
Objection! There is evidence of Louis Capet’s treason against the people of France. He should be tried as a foreigner and enemy, not a Citizen of the Republic!
$FAB_003_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Citizen Capet to death by guillotine! Take him away.
$FAB_003_OnGuilty_01
Long live the people!
$FAB_003_OnGuilty_02
Down with the tyrant!
$FAB_003_OnPrison_00
I sentence Citizen Capet to prison! Take him away.
$FAB_003_OnPrison_01
Arrest the Judge immediately!
$FAB_003_OnPrison_02
Outrageous!
$FAB_003_OnNotGuilty_00
The verdict in the case of Citizen Capet is… not guilty! The defendant is free to go.
$FAB_003_OnNotGuilty_01
Arrest the Judge immediately!
$FAB_003_OnNotGuilty_02
Outrageous!
$FAB_003_01x02_00_QTitle
Did the accused strive to abolish the National Constituent Assembly?
$FAB_003_01x02_00_00
Did the accused strive to abolish the National Constituent Assembly?
$FAB_003_01x02_00_01
I would not convoke the Estates-General for the first time in generations and then acknowledge the National Assembly to act against it and all the required reforms.
$FAB_003_01x02_00_02
Then why would you call in armed forces after the National Assembly’s transformation into the National Constituent Assembly?
$FAB_003_01x02_00_03
My ministers pressed me to ensure my people’s safety.
$FAB_003_01x02_00_04
That is a bold statement, considering how many of your people were killed during the unrest in July.
$FAB_003_01x02_00_05
That pains me greatly, but the only person responsible for that is Baron de Besenval.
$FAB_003_01x02_00_06
Objection! De Besenval carried out Capet’s orders!
$FAB_003_01x03_01_QTitle
What did the accused plan to do with the Constituent’s deputies?
$FAB_003_01x03_01_00
What did the accused plan to do with the Constituent’s deputies?
$FAB_003_01x03_01_01
Nothing. The Assembly that I joined on 27th June 1789 granted immunity to its members, and I intended to respect that.
$FAB_003_01x03_01_02
And yet you ordered your soldiers to seize and imprison the deputies, and perhaps even execute them.
$FAB_003_01x03_01_03
Nonsense. There is no evidence of that. My enemies spread rumours to get rid of me.
$FAB_003_01x03_01_04
We don’t need evidence against a coward who runs from his own people!
$FAB_003_02x08_02_QTitle
Who issued the order to fire at Citizens…?
$FAB_003_02x08_02_00
Who issued the order to fire at Citizens defending the National Constituent Assembly?
$FAB_003_02x08_02_01
Either Marshal de Broglie or Baron de Besenval. The one responsible should be the one standing here as he was not authorised to issue such orders.
$FAB_003_02x08_02_02
Really? Not according to this document. It was signed by the Marshal.
$FAB_003_02x08_02_03
Marshal de Broglie went too far and lied to us all. I swear on my crown, I did not issue that order!
$FAB_003_02x08_02_04
De Broglie is a sworn Monarchist and was given an army to suppress the Revolution. Would he work on his own, without Capet’s blessing?
$FAB_003_02x08_02_05
People sometimes do stupid things…
$FAB_003_02x03_03_QTitle
Has the accused ever considered Paris and its Citizens to be his enemies?
$FAB_003_02x03_03_00
Has the accused ever considered Paris and its Citizens to be his enemies?
$FAB_003_02x03_03_01
Absolutely not. I ask that you explain the question.
$FAB_003_02x03_03_02
How can you deny it if you do not understand the question? Your armies surrounded Paris. Is that not what you do to your enemies?
$FAB_003_02x03_03_03
My soldiers were there only to ensure public order while the National Assembly was in session.
$FAB_003_02x03_03_04
Adequate forces were already present in Paris. Was that not enough?
$FAB_003_02x03_03_05
…
$FAB_003_04x07_04_QTitle
Call in the witness, Jean Douret.
$FAB_003_04x07_04_00
Call in the witness, Jean Douret.
$FAB_003_04x07_04_02
Please introduce yourself.
$FAB_003_04x07_04_03
Jean Douret, postmaster of Sainte-Menehould, monsieur le juge.
$FAB_003_05x06_05_QTitle
Who was responsible for the delivery of the passport…
$FAB_003_05x06_05_00
Who was responsible for the delivery of the passport of the man called Pinet?
$FAB_003_05x06_05_01
My butler. I ordered him to prepare all the formalities regarding travel to Montmédy.
$FAB_003_05x06_05_02
The City Hall has not received any submissions from your butler.
$FAB_003_05x06_05_03
I do not know what to say…
$FAB_003_05x06_05_04
Monsieur le juge! Louis Capet’s butler was seen at the Austrian embassy. They surely took care of all the documents for the defectors.
$FAB_003_05x06_05_05
Monsieur Tinville, that is mere hearsay! Who said such a thing? Bring him here so that he may repeat it!
$FAB_003_05x06_05_06
There is no need. That is hard evidence, especially in light of what the accused has told us.
$FAB_003_08x05_06_QTitle
Who helped you suppress the Revolution?
$FAB_003_08x05_06_00
Who helped you suppress the Revolution? Frederick William II? Francis II? Catherine II? Or maybe your relative Charles IV?
$FAB_003_08x05_06_01
Justice awaits them as well!
$FAB_003_08x05_06_02
Nonsense, all of it. My only desire to take my family out of Paris as I did not wish for them to suffer house arrest.
$FAB_003_08x05_06_03
We all know the European monarchs despise our ideals of freedom, equality, and brotherhood. Am I to understand that you tried to prepare a joint military intervention?
$FAB_003_08x05_06_04
I deny any such accusation. There is no evidence for such outrageous claims. I would never turn against my beloved France!
$FAB_003_08x05_06_05
Liar!
$FAB_003_08x05_06_06
He’d sell his own mother, never mind his country!
$FAB_003_08x10_07_QTitle
Tell us one thing: When does a leader order a muster?
$FAB_003_08x10_07_00
Tell us one thing: When does a leader order a muster?
$FAB_003_08x10_07_01
When there is a need to strengthen discipline and inspire courage.
$FAB_003_08x10_07_02
So you admit that you encouraged the Guard to attack Paris?
$FAB_003_08x10_07_03
No. There were many armed Citizens around the palace already. I only wanted to give my troops hope during the defence. I would like to emphasise the fact that my family were in grave danger.
$FAB_003_08x10_07_04
If their lives were in danger, the fault lay with you. It was not the first time you sent your troops to fight Citizens!
$FAB_003_08x10_07_05
Gentlemen, I look in vain for a judge here, for I only see accusers before me.
$FAB_003_11x08_08_QTitle
Who gave the order to shoot the Citizens gathered around the palace?
$FAB_003_11x08_08_00
Who gave the order to shoot the Citizens gathered around the palace?
$FAB_003_11x08_08_01
I did. But it was not an order to attack. The Guard’s duty was only to respond if the Citizens attacked. Their duty was to protect my family!
$FAB_003_11x08_08_02
In that case, they should have ceased fire as soon as you escaped to the National Assembly with your family.
$FAB_003_11x08_08_03
It was chaos. I did not have a chance to give such an order, but I did so immediately upon arriving at the Assembly.
$FAB_003_11x08_08_04
So the accused has innocent blood on his hands.
$FAB_003_08x09_09_QTitle
Was the accused planning to reclaim his authority in Paris…
$FAB_003_08x09_09_00
Was the accused planning to reclaim his authority in Paris and re-establish an absolute monarchy?
$FAB_003_08x09_09_01
Why would I do that? According to constitutional law I was still the King!
$FAB_003_08x09_09_02
Then why did you raise a number of troops in the Tuileries?
$FAB_003_08x09_09_03
I feared for my family’s life. It is not a mystery that the Citizens of Paris were incited to seize the palace and capture us, especially as it was Mr Danton’s goal.
$FAB_003_08x09_09_04
It is clear, then, that the Guard were organised against the Citizens of Paris, many of whom did fall in the Tuileries!
$FAB_003_08x09_09_05
Against violence and disorder, Mr Tinville. Not against my people.
$FAB_003_WIT_00_A_QTitle
Did the accused, Louis Capet, introduce himself to the witness with his full name?
$FAB_003_WIT_00_A_00
Did the accused, Louis Capet, introduce himself to the witness with his full name?
$FAB_003_WIT_00_A_01
No, he didn’t introduce himself at all. He only produced someone else’s documents.
$FAB_003_WIT_00_A_02
So he tried to hide his identity?
$FAB_003_WIT_00_A_03
You could say so. I used the name from the documents after he showed them to me. He never objected.
$FAB_003_WIT_00_A_04
Then how did you learn of his true identity?
$FAB_003_WIT_00_A_05
By the image on the paper assignation. Then a messenger from General La Fayette confirmed my suspicions. I ran as fast as I could to Varennes to inform the authorities.
$FAB_003_WIT_01_A_QTitle
Did the accused tell anyone the destination of his journey?
$FAB_003_WIT_01_A_00
Did the accused tell anyone the destination of his journey?
$FAB_003_WIT_01_A_01
He asked for the way to Montmédy. I told him to go through Varennes-en-Argonne and warned the coachman to be careful. The road is difficult there.
$FAB_003_WIT_01_A_03
Would the accused like to comment on this testimony?
$FAB_003_WIT_01_A_04
It confirms that I had no intention of escaping. I was merely travelling. It is the right of any free Citizen.
$FAB_003_WIT_01_B_QTitle
Was the accused acting like a defector? Was he nervous or in a hurry?
$FAB_003_WIT_01_B_00
Was the accused acting like a defector? Was he nervous or in a hurry?
$FAB_003_WIT_01_B_01
No, the King… I mean Capet, was in no hurry… He even found the time to jest.
$FAB_003_WIT_01_B_02
What about the Capets?
$FAB_003_WIT_01_B_03
That I do not know. Only the King would leave the carriage. I mean Capet… Judging by his clothes, I thought he was merely a townsman.
$FAB_003_WIT_01_B_05
Would the accused like to comment on this testimony?
$FAB_003_WIT_01_B_06
I do not see anything wrong with travelling in modest, comfortable clothing. It is even advisable for practical reasons.
$FAB_003_WIT_01_B_07
It would be advisable during an escape. Especially if a monarch were trying to sneak away.
