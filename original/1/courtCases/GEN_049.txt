	After the torrential rain that haunted Paris two weeks ago, <a name="1" class="hidden">a drowned boy</a> was found in one of the sewers leading to the Seine. He was no more than 14 years old. His neat clothes led us to believe that he was not an urchin, so we started to look for his family. The search did not yield the expected results.

	A few days later, an anonymous denunciation was left at one of the National Guard posts. Its author claimed that the mysterious corpse was connected to a mansion in the northern suburbs of Paris. A patrol sent to check on the revelations was forced to retreat when someone started <a name="4" class="hidden">shooting at them from the doorstep</a>.

	The soldiers returned with reinforcements to discover a terrifying scene. Four suspicious-looking men were loading young, dazed boys into a cart like bags of potatoes. Ten boys total were found in the building, all from the country and none older than 15. The basement was filled with shelves lined with jars of laudanum. There was also <a name="6" class="hidden">a paddock with sheep, goats, cows, horses, and dogs</a>.

	Two of the four men were captured alive. They testified that the disturbing place was a kind of a brothel belonging to a certain Raoul Battier. The Guard lay in ambush and caught the host together with <a name="7" class="hidden">two clients</a>.

Please introduce yourself.
$GEN_049_OnStart_01
Raoul Battier, at your service.
$GEN_049_OnStart_02
No, thank you. Do I understand correctly that you work as a procurer?
$GEN_049_OnStart_03
I wouldn’t use such strong words. We were merely providing entertainment to the rich… and served several particularly demanding clients. You’d be amazed by how many of them you know personally.
$GEN_049_OnStart_04
Are you pleading guilty?
$GEN_049_OnStart_05
I was merely providing a product that was in high demand.
$GEN_049_OnStart_06
You mean young boys?
$GEN_049_OnStart_07
I would rather say that my main trade was pleasant time.
$GEN_049_OnGuilty_00
Citizen Battier, you have committed hideous crimes. This city will breathe a sigh of relief when your head finally rolls down the street.
$GEN_049_OnGuilty_01
Death to the monster!
$GEN_049_OnGuilty_02
No more hurting children!
$GEN_049_OnGuilty_03
Why not drown him in the Seine? That would only be fair.
$GEN_049_OnPrison_00
Citizen Battier, I find you guilty. From this day forth, you shall call prison your home.
$GEN_049_OnPrison_01
I would rather see him beheaded, but I believe that he will not have an easy life in prison.
$GEN_049_OnPrison_02
Not enough!
$GEN_049_OnPrison_03
You call that justice?
$GEN_049_OnPrison_04
Remove that stupid smile with the guillotine!
$GEN_049_OnNotGuilty_00
I find Raoul Battier not guilty due to a lack of conclusive evidence against him.
$GEN_049_OnNotGuilty_01
The judge is a sodomite!
$GEN_049_OnNotGuilty_02
He was bought for a night with a sheep!
$GEN_049_OnNotGuilty_03
The judge should be ashamed!
$GEN_049_OnNotGuilty_04
This must be a nightmare!
$GEN_049_04x03_00_QTitle
Your people opened fire on the National Guard. Did you give the order?
$GEN_049_04x03_00_00
Your people opened fire on the National Guard. Did you give the order?
$GEN_049_04x03_00_01
There’s been a tragic misunderstanding, that’s all…
$GEN_049_04x03_00_02
You seem to be very confident. Do you know the fate that may await you?
$GEN_049_04x03_00_03
The guillotine and nothing else!
$GEN_049_04x03_00_04
You are a reasonable person. The mob wants blood, of course, but you know that entrepreneurs can be forgiven for the minor sins they commit.
$GEN_049_04x03_00_05
What do you call a minor sin?
$GEN_049_04x03_00_06
My people were on edge, nervous, and confused your people with… well, burglars, I suppose. It happens.
$GEN_049_04x03_00_07
So you believe that nothing bad really happened?
$GEN_049_04x03_00_08
Well, if you were to close every small business for trivial reasons, France would go bankrupt.
$GEN_049_04x03_00_09
Do not change the subject. Were you planning to smuggle the boys somewhere?
$GEN_049_04x03_00_10
They are still young and were scared by the shots, so we had to move them somewhere quieter.
$GEN_049_06x03_01_QTitle
Did your clients like to feast after their perverted pleasures?
$GEN_049_06x03_01_00
Did your clients like to feast after their perverted pleasures?
$GEN_049_06x03_01_01
Oh, they did not come for food at all. The wealthy Citizens of Paris have very surprising preferences when it comes to love…
$GEN_049_06x03_01_02
Perverts!
$GEN_049_06x03_01_03
You can find a regular whore at every other corner. We were visited by people who wanted something more.
$GEN_049_06x03_01_04
Are you trying to say that your clients… had intercourse with cattle?
$GEN_049_06x03_01_05
There’s no need for such crass descriptions. You call for freedom, and at the same time forbid people a little earthly pleasure.
$GEN_049_06x03_01_06
Those boys who were imprisoned in your, what did you call it, business – were they also free?
$GEN_049_06x03_01_07
Were they copulating or not?
$GEN_049_06x03_01_08
They were, indeed. They were willing and they got paid well, so why not?
$GEN_049_07x01_02_QTitle
You were kidnapping, drugging, and murdering children. The corpses were then thrown in the sewer. Do you admit it, Citizen?

You were kidnapping, drugging, and murdering children. The corpses were then thrown in the sewer. Do you admit it, Citizen?
$GEN_049_07x01_02_01
They were lost country boys. Someone in Paris would have abused them anyway. They’d have ended up as tanners or factory workers, slaving for a piece of bread. We gave them a much better alternative.
$GEN_049_07x01_02_02
Did they think the same? Did you even try to find out what they wanted?
$GEN_049_07x01_02_03
I’m not sure, my people were supposed to do that.
$GEN_049_07x01_02_04
We would love to talk to them.
$GEN_049_07x01_02_05
Unfortunately, you killed them when attacking my mansion.
$GEN_049_07x01_02_06
How convenient for you. Did you drug the kids with laudanum?
$GEN_049_07x01_02_07
A glass of wine with a little opium helped those sweet boys to unwind before work. They begged for it – how could I say no?
$GEN_049_07x01_02_08
I wouldn’t say no to smashing his face with a stick!
$GEN_049_07x01_02_09
And once they were of no use to you, they were thrown into a sewer?
$GEN_049_07x01_02_10
Believe me, I wanted to avoid it.
$GEN_049_02x01_03_QTitle
The boy found in the sewer was well dressed. Who was he?
$GEN_049_02x01_03_00
The boy found in the sewer was well dressed. Who was he?
$GEN_049_02x01_03_01
I’m not sure… I gave them those clothes, as they came to us dressed in rags. Besides, I won’t remember them all. You should ask our clients, as they like to chit-chat afterwards.
$GEN_049_02x01_03_02
Who used your services?
$GEN_049_02x01_03_03
Marquises, generals, officials, pepper merchants, bishops. Judges.
$GEN_049_02x01_03_04
Did you hear him? Bishops were going there!
$GEN_049_02x01_03_05
I want to hear names.
$GEN_049_02x01_03_06
You won’t hear them from me, even if you decide to make a fatal error and dare to sentence me to death.
$GEN_049_02x01_03_07
What should I be afraid of?
$GEN_049_02x01_03_08
Monsieur le juge, my clients would never forgive you. I'm as important for this city as a baker. I satisfy a very particular, yet human, hunger of the elites – and you want to hinder it. Tomorrow, you yourself may well be recognised as an enemy of the Revolution.
$GEN_049_03x07_04_QTitle
How do your clients know where to look for you?

How do your clients know where to look for you?
$GEN_049_03x07_04_01
Paris is an amazing place. People who want to spend money on pleasure will always find someone to bring it to them.
$GEN_049_03x07_04_02
I assume the word of mouth was used to spread it among them.
$GEN_049_03x07_04_03
You are very clever!
$GEN_049_03x07_04_04
In other words, if we catch one, we will catch them all!
$GEN_049_03x07_04_05
You have much to gain by giving me those names.
$GEN_049_03x07_04_06
I’m afraid that if you learned them, you would be terrified by the way you’ve been talking to me.
$GEN_049_03x07_04_07
Justice does not care for your connections.
$GEN_049_03x07_04_08
Yes, tell him!
$GEN_049_03x07_04_09
Justice may not care… but you should.

The panderer said that his people started shooting the Guard because…

They confused them with burglars.
$GEN_049_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_00
They were expecting their rivals.
$GEN_049_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_01
The Guard opened fire at them first.
