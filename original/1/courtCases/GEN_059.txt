	Anne de Korff, 67, is a <a name="1" class="hidden">widow</a> who currently owns an enormous fortune that she inherited from her late husband, Baron de Clichy. Before the Revolution, she was one of Marie Antoinette’s <a name="3" class="hidden">trusted courtiers</a>. After the events in 1789, she cut ties with the court; however, she recently became a frequent guest at <a name="4" class="hidden">the Tuileries</a>, where the Capets were being kept. She also took part in Count de Fersen’s scheme to facilitate the escape of the monarchs from the Tuileries.
$GEN_059_DOC_1_01
	Following de Fersen’s orders, de Korff supposedly bought <a name="6" class="hidden">a new carriage</a> in her own name. The purchase of a berline carriage for six passengers, sufficient to carry the Capets from Paris, was made at Jean Louis’s workshop. The valet of the baroness, Gilbert, testified that the carriage was delivered to the count shortly before the escape.
$GEN_059_DOC_1_02
	It is widely known that de Fersen himself, dressed as a coachman, drove the carriage as far as Bondy. Interestingly enough, when the monarchs were stopped in Varennes, Marie-Antoinette had <a name="7" class="hidden">a newly issued passport</a> under the name of Anne de Korff, which she was using during the trip.
$GEN_059_DOC_1_03
	The streets of Paris are humming with gossip. They say that Anne helped the count not because of her sympathy towards the monarchs but because of an affair they had in the past, and the elderly aristocrat’s <a name="8" class="hidden">unquenchable desire</a>.

Dear Baroness,

In faith, J. L.
$GEN_059_OnStart_00
Supporter of tyranny!
$GEN_059_OnStart_01
Please introduce yourself.
$GEN_059_OnStart_02
Baroness Anne de Korff.
$GEN_059_OnStart_03
Anne de Korff, you have been accused of conspiring to facilitate the escape of the Capets from France. Do you plead guilty?
$GEN_059_OnStart_04
Monsieur le juge, there has been a misunderstanding! I had nothing to do with that!
$GEN_059_OnStart_05
The evidence speaks against the accused.
$GEN_059_OnStart_06
That is impossible!
$GEN_059_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Citizen Anne de Korff to be guillotined! Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_059_OnGuilty_01
That’s how all of Capet’s followers will end up!
$GEN_059_OnGuilty_02
Bravo!
$GEN_059_OnPrison_00
I sentence Citizen Anne de Korff to prison! Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_059_OnPrison_01
What?!
$GEN_059_OnPrison_02
Is there no justice?!
$GEN_059_OnNotGuilty_00
The verdict in the case of Anne de Korff is… not guilty! Lead the defendant out.
$GEN_059_OnNotGuilty_01
Scandal! Treason!
$GEN_059_OnNotGuilty_02
Maybe you’re also scheming with de Fersen?
$GEN_059_02x06_00_QTitle
How many carriages are in the defendant’s coach house?
$GEN_059_02x06_00_00
How many carriages are in the defendant’s coach house?
$GEN_059_02x06_00_01
If I remember correctly, three.
$GEN_059_02x06_00_02
We can’t remember the last time we ate meat, and she - how many carriages she owns!
$GEN_059_02x06_00_03
Then why would you order another carriage in Jean Louis’s workshop? Does a lonely widow really need a fourth carriage?
$GEN_059_02x06_00_04
Because my wealth allowed it, monsieur le juge. Since when is spending money on feminine caprices a crime?
$GEN_059_02x06_00_05
It is when those caprices serve Count de Fersen’s conspiracy. We know that he instructed you to buy it.
$GEN_059_02x06_00_06
Nonsense! I ordered it for my own trip to Montmédy!
$GEN_059_06x09_01_QTitle
Could you describe the carriage you ordered from Jean Louis?
$GEN_059_06x09_01_00
Could you describe the carriage you ordered from Jean Louis?
$GEN_059_06x09_01_01
It was a luxurious berline, painted green and yellow.
$GEN_059_06x09_01_02
The Capets attempted to escape in a carriage that exactly matches this description. Where is the carriage now?
$GEN_059_06x09_01_03
I swear that I had nothing to do with the escape of Louis and his wife from the Tuileries!
$GEN_059_06x09_01_04
Answer the question!
$GEN_059_06x09_01_05
I… Well… I lent it to Count de Fersen… But I swear on all that is sacred I did not know the scoundrel’s true intention!
$GEN_059_06x09_01_06
You think anyone will believe that?!
$GEN_059_06x09_01_07
What did the accused think he was going to use it for?
$GEN_059_06x09_01_08
He said that it would be used by the Swedish ambassador. Why should I have disbelieved the count?
$GEN_059_05x07_02_QTitle
How is it possible that the defendant’s passport was being held by Marie-Antoinette?
$GEN_059_05x07_02_00
How is it possible that the defendant’s passport was being held by Marie-Antoinette?
$GEN_059_05x07_02_01
It was stolen from my apartment… It must have been Count de Fersen!
$GEN_059_05x07_02_02
And, of course, you immediately reported the theft?
$GEN_059_05x07_02_03
I ordered my valet Gilbert to do that.
$GEN_059_05x07_02_04
How interesting that the Parisian police received no such claim.
$GEN_059_05x07_02_05
I do not know what to say… I have no idea why Gilbert did not follow my order…
$GEN_059_05x07_02_06
And the Citizen did not see that it was done?
$GEN_059_05x07_02_07
I am a rather busy person, it must have slipped my mind.
$GEN_059_05x07_02_08
Those filthy aristocrats are really hard-working, aren’t they?
$GEN_059_04x07_03_QTitle
Why would the accused visit the Capets in the Tuileries?
$GEN_059_04x07_03_00
Why would the accused visit the Capets in the Tuileries?
$GEN_059_04x07_03_01
The visit was purely social. As an elderly person, I struggle with loneliness in Paris.
$GEN_059_04x07_03_02
That is most strange considering that the accused severed relations with the royal court when the Revolution began.
$GEN_059_04x07_03_03
I wish to see all the people I met in Versailles before I die. Is that so wrong?
$GEN_059_04x07_03_04
Was it during the visit that you handed Marie-Antoinette your passport?
$GEN_059_04x07_03_05
Absolutely not! There was a guard who would not look away even for a second! Those terrible people never leave her side, the poor, anguished woman.
$GEN_059_04x07_03_06
And yet, by some miracle, your passport still found its way to her.
$GEN_059_04x07_03_07
I had nothing to do with it!
$GEN_059_03x05_04_QTitle
The accused quite hurriedly ordered a new carriage and passport. Why?
$GEN_059_03x05_04_00
The accused quite hurriedly ordered a new carriage and passport. Why?
$GEN_059_03x05_04_01
Madame de Gasperi invited me to Montmédy.
$GEN_059_03x05_04_02
What a strange coincidence! That is exactly where the Capets were supposed to be taken!
$GEN_059_03x05_04_03
Indeed, but it was still only a coincidence. They tend to be peculiar and unusual.
$GEN_059_03x05_04_04
She’s mocking us!
$GEN_059_05x08_05_QTitle
What is your relationship with Count de Fersen?
$GEN_059_05x08_05_00
What is your relationship with Count de Fersen?
$GEN_059_05x08_05_01
Only friendship, monsieur le juge. At my age, I cannot expect anything more… unfortunately.
$GEN_059_05x08_05_02
Was there something more in the past?
$GEN_059_05x08_05_03
Not as much as the people at court like to suppose.
$GEN_059_05x08_05_04
But you knew each other well.
$GEN_059_05x08_05_05
You could say that, yes, I trusted him then. But now, because of him, I’m an elderly woman stuck in a prison cell.
$GEN_059_03x04_06_QTitle
What does the accused think about the monarchy?
$GEN_059_03x04_06_00
What does the accused think about the monarchy?
$GEN_059_03x04_06_01
I do not know much about politics, but I support the Revolution, if that is what you are asking, monsieur le juge.
$GEN_059_03x04_06_02
Is that why you left court?
$GEN_059_03x04_06_03
That is a completely different story and not related to politics at all.
$GEN_059_03x04_06_04
What was it related to?
$GEN_059_03x04_06_05
I faced some baseless accusations of a small scandal involving me and a married general.
$GEN_059_03x04_06_06
Did the defendant, despite those circumstances, maintain good relations with Citizen Capet’s wife? Good enough to help her?
$GEN_059_03x04_06_07
I could only pray for her. At my age one does not have enough strength for conspiracies.
$GEN_059_01x06_07_QTitle
Why would a lonely woman need a carriage for as many as six passengers?
$GEN_059_01x06_07_00
Why would a lonely woman need a carriage for as many as six passengers?
$GEN_059_01x06_07_01
Because a lonely woman wants to travel with company. There are still some people I can invite.
$GEN_059_01x06_07_02
Or you could plan to help the Royal Family, of exactly six people, in their escape.
$GEN_059_01x06_07_03
I am not the only person in this city who owns a berline carriage for six people, monsieur le juge.
$GEN_059_01x06_07_04
But the other owners are not plotting against the state…
$GEN_059_01x06_07_05
Perhaps not with the use of carriages.
$GEN_059_01x06_07_06
True, we’re surrounded by serpents!
