	Vincent Boulle is a young <a name="1" class="hidden">war invalid</a>. He lost his leg below the knee to a Prussian cannon ball. He was discharged from the military and moved in with his mother and younger brother, 14-year-old Mathéo, to an apartment in a tenement.
$GEN_052_DOC_01_01
	Not long ago, Vincent’s brother <a name="3" class="hidden">fell from a window</a>. The doctors say that he broke both legs and his pelvis, and would probably never walk again. We learned that on the night of the incident, a loud quarrel could be heard from the widow’s apartment. We asked the doctors from Hôtel-Dieu to examine the boy a second time and they found both old <a name="5" class="hidden">scars and fresh bruises</a> on his body.
$GEN_052_DOC_01_02
	Neighbours told us that during the first months after <a name="6" class="hidden">the return of the wounded soldier</a>, they did not notice anything disturbing. However, eventually they began to hear screams at night. Vincent was sometimes seen with a bottle of wine, reeking of alcohol and behaving aggressively.
$GEN_052_DOC_01_03
	We have arrested Vincent Boulle, hoping for incriminating testimonies given by his <a name="8" class="hidden">mother and brother</a>. However, she claimed that Mathéo is young and stupid, and fell from the window by himself. The boy has refused to talk to us.
$GEN_052_OnStart_00
You are Citizen Vincent Boulle?
$GEN_052_OnStart_01
That’s me.
$GEN_052_OnStart_02
Did you have anything to do with your brother’s fall from the window?
$GEN_052_OnStart_03
The stripling was playing on the windowsill and he just slipped.
$GEN_052_OnStart_04
You do not appear to feel sorry for him.
$GEN_052_OnStart_05
He had an accident. Things like that happen.
$GEN_052_OnStart_06
An accident? So you were not involved?
$GEN_052_OnStart_07
He couldn’t handle the Prussians, so he started fighting with his family.
$GEN_052_OnStart_08
Mother first drove my father to death, and now she doesn’t really look after my brother. You should ask her.
$GEN_052_OnGuilty_00
For domestic violence, I sentence Citizen Boulle to death.
$GEN_052_OnGuilty_01
I would have been surprised if you had given another verdict.
$GEN_052_OnGuilty_02
Fine, but will it heal the child’s legs?
$GEN_052_OnPrison_00
Citizen Boulle, for your crimes against your own family I sentence you to prison.
$GEN_052_OnPrison_01
Chain that bastard up and to the quarry with him!
$GEN_052_OnNotGuilty_00
This case is dismissed. Citizen Boulle, you may return home.
$GEN_052_OnNotGuilty_01
I understand a certain lenience towards war veterans, but this is ridiculous.
$GEN_052_OnNotGuilty_02
He’ll be back in a week, accused of murdered.
$GEN_052_01x07_00_QTitle
Did you join the army as a very young man?
$GEN_052_01x07_00_00
Did you join the army as a very young man?
$GEN_052_01x07_00_01
I was under 20.
$GEN_052_01x07_00_02
Losing a leg must have been a difficult experience.
$GEN_052_01x07_00_03
I don’t want to talk about it!
$GEN_052_01x07_00_04
How did it happen?
$GEN_052_01x07_00_05
I don’t want to talk about it!
$GEN_052_01x07_00_06
Citizen, tell us how you lost your leg.
$GEN_052_01x07_00_07
I don’t remember.
$GEN_052_01x07_00_08
Maybe he was shot in the head, not his leg?
$GEN_052_01x07_00_09
Fine, let us assume that you do not remember that exact moment. What about the day of the incident? Were you on the offensive?
$GEN_052_01x07_00_10
That has nothing to do with that stupid child falling out of the window!
$GEN_052_01x07_00_11
Citizen, we are doing you a favour by hearing you out. Be so good as to not shout.
$GEN_052_01x07_00_12
…
$GEN_052_01x07_00_13
Did you start drinking because of your leg?
$GEN_052_01x07_00_14
No, it’s insomnia. I can’t fall asleep these days without a glass of wine.
$GEN_052_02x06_01_QTitle
Your neighbours say that when you returned from the war, at first you were calm…
$GEN_052_02x06_01_00
Your neighbours say that when you returned from the war, at first you were calm, yet as time went by you became increasingly more aggressive. What happened?
$GEN_052_02x06_01_01
I don’t understand the question, monsieur le juge.
$GEN_052_02x06_01_02
Of course he doesn’t. Squeaky clean, that one.
$GEN_052_02x06_01_03
For some time now, your neighbours have been complaining about you. When you started drinking, they began to hear screams from your apartment.
$GEN_052_02x06_01_04
I haven’t been getting along with my mother recently, but it was nothing serious.
$GEN_052_02x06_01_05
You did not get along? Or were you arguing?
$GEN_052_02x06_01_06
Nothing serious, just some small disagreements.
$GEN_052_02x06_01_07
But it did not start straight after your return?
$GEN_052_02x06_01_08
I just can’t sleep lately. Tired people are often easily irritated.
$GEN_052_08x04_02_QTitle
Call in the widow, Mrs Boulle, as a witness.
$GEN_052_08x04_02_00
Call in the widow, Mrs Boulle, as a witness.
$GEN_052_03x05_03_QTitle
How would you describe your relationship with your brother?
$GEN_052_03x05_03_00
How would you describe your relationship with your brother?
$GEN_052_03x05_03_01
Mathéo? That little maggot does nothing but eat and ask mother for money because he’s too lazy to work.
$GEN_052_03x05_03_02
Your brother has never worked?
$GEN_052_03x05_03_03
Well, he was a baker’s or butcher’s apprentice, I’m not sure which. Still, whatever he brought home, he ate at once.
$GEN_052_03x05_03_04
How about you? Where are you working?
$GEN_052_03x05_03_05
Without a leg, what can I do, hmm? Roll cigars with women?
$GEN_052_03x05_03_06
Be honest with us. Were you beating your brother?
$GEN_052_03x05_03_07
He was battering him! You could hear it from two streets away!
$GEN_052_03x05_03_08
Someone has to bring him up as a man. I was raised by my father, but he died when Mathéo was eight. There was nobody with a firm hand at home and now look at him.
$GEN_052_03x05_03_09
Not that his father did a great job of raising this one.
$GEN_052_07x04_04_QTitle
Were you drinking on the night of your brother’s fall from the window?
$GEN_052_07x04_04_00
Were you drinking on the night of your brother’s fall from the window?
$GEN_052_07x04_04_01
No, monsieur le juge, that night I was sober.
$GEN_052_07x04_04_02
Your neighbours heard screams.
$GEN_052_07x04_04_03
Probably from the street. Maybe there was another lynching or something? I don’t know, I was sleeping.
$GEN_052_07x04_04_04
Did you take your brother to the hospital?
$GEN_052_07x04_04_05
No, our neighbours did. I found out about everything in the morning, when they came to complain.
$GEN_052_07x04_04_06
Why did you not take him yourself? Were you ashamed?
$GEN_052_07x04_04_07
I couldn’t sleep for three nights. So when I finally managed to, I slept like a log.
$GEN_052_07x04_04_08
We heard you yelling!
$GEN_052_07x04_04_09
Did you visit your brother?
$GEN_052_07x04_04_10
I was sitting by him when an officer of the Guard came to interrogate him. Mathéo was asked a bunch of questions, but didn’t say anything. I guess he was ashamed to have ruined his health in such a stupid way.
$GEN_052_01x06_05_QTitle
How long did you serve in the army?
$GEN_052_01x06_05_00
How long did you serve in the army?
$GEN_052_01x06_05_01
Over a year. The whole time I was thinking about going back to my mother and brother…
$GEN_052_01x06_05_02
And once you returned home, the trouble started.
$GEN_052_01x06_05_03
They didn’t understand me. They don’t know what it’s like when your friend’s blood splatters over your face… They were complaining that I scream at night. I was calling Pinard. I dreamt about him every night. A bullet went through his cheek.
$GEN_052_01x06_05_04
Did Pinard survive?
$GEN_052_01x06_05_05
I don’t know. Two days later I was hit by the cannonball. I have no idea what happened to him.
$GEN_052_01x06_05_06
Your neighbours also complained about screams.
$GEN_052_01x06_05_07
They never had to shake someone’s guts off their shoes… What do they know about screams and fear?
$GEN_052_01x06_05_08
Do you want us to feel sorry for you?
$GEN_052_01x06_05_09
You can all go and jump in the river, for all I care.
$GEN_052_WIT_00_A_QTitle
How did your younger son fall out of the window?
$GEN_052_WIT_00_A_00
How did your younger son fall out of the window?
$GEN_052_WIT_00_A_01
I think he was playing on the windowsill.
$GEN_052_WIT_00_A_02
It happened at night, right?
$GEN_052_WIT_00_A_03
Well… yes.
$GEN_052_WIT_00_A_04
Did he often play at this hour instead of sleeping?
$GEN_052_WIT_00_A_05
My son doesn’t have a father. Sometimes he’s hard to control.
$GEN_052_WIT_00_A_06
What were you doing on the night of the incident when your son was playing?
$GEN_052_WIT_00_A_07
I was doing the laundry. The boys constantly stain their clothes, and as I work all day, I have to wash them late at night.
$GEN_052_WIT_00_A_08
And your older son? What was he doing?
$GEN_052_WIT_00_A_09
I’m not sure.
$GEN_052_WIT_00_A_10
Could he have been sleeping?
$GEN_052_WIT_00_A_11
No, no, he suffers from insomnia and–
$GEN_052_WIT_00_A_12
He’s beating his family.
$GEN_052_WIT_01_A_QTitle
Do your sons get along?
$GEN_052_WIT_01_A_00
Do your sons get along?
$GEN_052_WIT_01_A_01
Well, you know what boys are like. They fight from time to time, but that’s just how they are.
$GEN_052_WIT_01_A_02
Stop defending him, woman!
$GEN_052_WIT_01_A_03
Your older son is no longer a child.
$GEN_052_WIT_01_A_04
He will always be a child to me. If you have children, you know what I’m talking about.
$GEN_052_WIT_01_A_05
Was Vincent hitting Mathéo?
$GEN_052_WIT_01_A_06
Not at all, he’s a good boy. They would sometimes get into a struggle together, but children do.
$GEN_052_WIT_01_A_07
Did he ever hurt him?
$GEN_052_WIT_01_A_08
When he was 15, he–
$GEN_052_WIT_01_A_09
You know what I’m asking about.
$GEN_052_WIT_01_A_10
My son is a decent person. I don’t really understand why he was arrested.
$GEN_052_WIT_01_B_QTitle
Has Vincent ever hit you, Citizen?
$GEN_052_WIT_01_B_00
Has Vincent ever hit you, Citizen?
$GEN_052_WIT_01_B_01
Of course not, monsieur le juge.
$GEN_052_WIT_01_B_02
Does he ever shout at you?
$GEN_052_WIT_01_B_03
He can’t sleep recently, and sometimes he raises his voice, but it passes when he sleeps well. His leg hurts where the stitches were, and I sometimes buy a bottle for him. Men always feel better after a drink.
$GEN_052_WIT_01_B_04
If you do not buy him a bottle, does he get angry?
$GEN_052_WIT_01_B_05
No, no, my son never gets angry at me, no.
$GEN_052_WIT_01_B_06
Of course he doesn’t, that good, kind boy.
$GEN_052_WIT_01_B_07
That night, could you afford a bottle for him?
$GEN_052_WIT_01_B_08
I don’t remember well, you know, I’m old. But no, I don’t think so.
