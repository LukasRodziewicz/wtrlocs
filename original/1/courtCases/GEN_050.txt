	<a name="1" class="hidden">Three privates</a> from the units based behind the Porte-Libre prison stole six geese from a suburban farm. The owner of the farm, Jean Capel, saw the infantrymen committing the robbery.
$GEN_050_DOC_01_01
	Armed with a pitchfork, Capel tried to stop the soldiers. One of the privates aimed <a name="3" class="hidden">a musket</a> at him and threatened to use it. Capel later testified that he was so scared he felt light-headed and ran to the pigsty.

	The farmer informed an officer stationed nearby about the robbery, and immediately an order was given to find the culprits. One of the soldiers was quickly found in an abandoned church. He was <a name="5" class="hidden">roasting three birds</a> over a small fire. The gendarmes arrested him and took his weapon – a regulation bayonet. The detainee did not give away his accomplices, even when promised that he would avoid trial in exchange.

Private Gaubert?
$GEN_050_OnStart_01
Private Michel Gaubert, monsieur le juge.
$GEN_050_OnStart_02
How long have you been in the army?
$GEN_050_OnStart_03
A year and four months, monsieur le juge.
$GEN_050_OnStart_04
Did you steal Jean Capel’s geese?
$GEN_050_OnStart_05
I, err… well… It just happened that I did.
$GEN_050_OnStart_06
It just happened? What does that mean?
$GEN_050_OnStart_07
Explain.
$GEN_050_OnStart_08
Not much was going on over that side of Paris, and we didn’t get much to eat.
$GEN_050_OnGuilty_00
Private Gaubert, you raised your hand against the people you swore to defend. There can only be one verdict: death.
$GEN_050_OnGuilty_01
That is what happens to thieves.
$GEN_050_OnGuilty_02
Find the other two and off with their heads!
$GEN_050_OnNotGuilty_00
I cannot punish our soldiers just because our army is unable to give them bread. I find Private Gaubert not guilty.
$GEN_050_OnNotGuilty_01
He admitted everything! We should be more demanding during war, not more lenient.
$GEN_050_OnNotGuilty_02
Go to the village and tell that to the farmers who’ll now be robbed by those bandits in uniforms.
$GEN_050_01x05_00_QTitle
There were three of you, yet you took three of the six stolen birds. Why?
$GEN_050_01x05_00_00
There were three of you, yet you took three of the six stolen birds. Why?
$GEN_050_01x05_00_01
I was told to cook three on the spot while they went to hide the rest of the loot. But they didn’t come back.
$GEN_050_01x05_00_02
I read in the files that you refused to give us their names.
$GEN_050_01x05_00_03
I don’t know who they were. They weren’t with us.
$GEN_050_01x05_00_04
What do you mean?
$GEN_050_01x05_00_05
They weren’t from our unit. I’d love to give them away, but they were just… ordinary. My age, in uniform – but one of them had ears that stick out.
$GEN_050_01x05_00_06
And now they’ll try to find the culprits by looking at people’s ears? What a joke!
$GEN_050_01x05_00_07
Tell us their first names at least, and I may believe that you are not covering for them.
$GEN_050_01x05_00_08
I think one of them referred to the other as Louis, but I couldn’t be sure.
$GEN_050_03x06_01_QTitle
Did you threaten to use your musket against the farmer?
$GEN_050_03x06_01_00
Did you threaten to use your musket against the farmer?
$GEN_050_03x06_01_01
It wasn’t me…
$GEN_050_03x06_01_02
Sure, that’s what they all say.
$GEN_050_03x06_01_03
I wouldn’t kill a person over a goose, monsieur le juge, even though I was as hungry as a wolf.
$GEN_050_03x06_01_04
But you took your bayonet with you. Why?
$GEN_050_03x06_01_05
I had to deal with the birds somehow. I could break their necks with my bare hands, but what about cutting them open?
$GEN_050_03x06_01_06
And if the farmer had attacked you with the pitchfork?
$GEN_050_03x06_01_07
And what?
$GEN_050_03x06_01_08
Would you have defended yourself?
$GEN_050_03x06_01_09
Well, if he wanted to stab me…
$GEN_050_03x06_01_10
They lost their minds out of hunger.
$GEN_050_01x04_02_QTitle
What were your troops ordered to do?
$GEN_050_01x04_02_00
What were your troops ordered to do?
$GEN_050_01x04_02_01
Behind the prison there’s a road leading south to Étampes. We were making sure the enemy cavalry didn’t attack us from that direction.
$GEN_050_01x04_02_02
How many of you were there?
$GEN_050_01x04_02_03
About three hundred, more or less. I’m not sure.
$GEN_050_01x04_02_04
How far was it from the church where you were detained?
$GEN_050_01x04_02_05
Why not ask him about the names of his parent’s cows and the size of his hat while you’re at it?
$GEN_050_01x04_02_06
That was in another direction, further to the west.
$GEN_050_01x04_02_07
Why did you not take the geese to your camp? If you had to steal food, you could have at least shared it.
$GEN_050_01x04_02_08
If I’d brought it there, I wouldn’t have gotten a single bite. Officers have stomachs too.
$GEN_050_02x03_03_QTitle
Start from the beginning: whose idea was it to go after food with your weapons?
$GEN_050_02x03_03_00
Start from the beginning: whose idea was it to go after food with your weapons?
$GEN_050_02x03_03_01
Does it matter? Nobody forced him to go.
$GEN_050_02x03_03_02
I was washing footwraps with the other two and one thing led to another.
$GEN_050_02x03_03_03
One thing led to another?
$GEN_050_02x03_03_04
We talked about how hungry we were, then we started thinking about places we might get some food.
$GEN_050_02x03_03_05
So you just decided to steal something?
$GEN_050_02x03_03_06
I’d have been happy to buy it, but there wasn’t a single denier in my pockets.
$GEN_050_02x03_03_07
Why did you bring your musket?
$GEN_050_02x03_03_08
I asked the same question, but one of them said we could hunt something on the way. I laughed at him, because what could we possibly find? A dog or a fat rat at best.
$GEN_050_02x03_03_09
Or a farmer. A bunch of bandits dressed up as soldiers!
$GEN_050_KEY_01
Three soldiers
$GEN_050_KEY_02
Six geese
$GEN_050_KEY_03
Musket
$GEN_050_KEY_04
Abandoned church
$GEN_050_KEY_05
Roast
$GEN_050_KEY_06
Bayonet
$GEN_050_LastDialog_00
All that because I was hungry. Will you ever feed people like me? You weren’t in my shoes…
$GEN_050_UNIQUE_QUESTION_00
Why did the defendant have a bayonet on him?
$GEN_050_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_00_00
To gut a bird.
$GEN_050_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_00_00
To threaten the farmer.
$GEN_050_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_00_01
He always carries it with him.
$GEN_050_UNIQUE_QUESTION_01
What were Gaubert’s troops ordered to do?
$GEN_050_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_01_00
They were watching the road.
$GEN_050_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_00
They were building fortifications.
$GEN_050_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_01
They were getting ready to outflank the enemy.
$GEN_050_UNIQUE_QUESTION_02
Did the soldier give the names of his accomplices?
$GEN_050_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_02_00
Only one.
$GEN_050_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_02_00
He gave the names.
$GEN_050_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_02_01
He refused to answer.
