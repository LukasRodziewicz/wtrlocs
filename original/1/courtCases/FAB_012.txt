In the dock sits Mathieu Burel, the former Commander-in-Chief of the National Guard. The defendant stands accused of <a name="2" class="hidden">causing the death of 34 people</a> who took part in a demonstration against monarchic authority.
$FAB_012_DOC_1_01
Around 3 p.m., two spontaneous groups of protesters stumbled upon each other in one of the streets leading to Place Vendôme. A quarrel broke out between the supporters and opponents of Citizen Capet, with both sides engaged in a heated argument. None of the involved parties managed to gain the upper hand, and they quickly resorted to <a name="4" class="hidden">name-calling and public threats</a>. Soon after, a National Guard detachment led by the defendant arrived on the scene. According to the eyewitness testimony of Blaise Fossett, Commander-in-Chief Mathieu Burel <a name="5" class="hidden">stood himself between the two groups</a> alone and attempted to talk sense into them. He was quickly shouted down by the protesters. A few of them vocally accused the commander-in-chief of violating their <a name="6" class="hidden">freedom of speech</a>.
$FAB_012_DOC_1_02
A rock flew over Burel’s head. He then walked up to the regiment that until this point had stood away from the crowds. The commander-in-chief <a name="7" class="hidden">ordered them to load their muskets</a> and aim at the protesters. He shouted to the mob that they should leave, which the people of France of course ignored. Then, as Fossett testified, “another rock barely missed his head.” This time <a name="8" class="hidden">it managed to hit one of the soldiers</a> in the chest, leaving him breathless for a moment. Burel ordered the troops to fire. Bullets reached 34 people in total on both sides of the protest.
$FAB_012_DOC_1_03
During his arrest, Burel tried to explain that he had <a name="9" class="hidden">the Tribunal’s opinion</a>, which stated he could use force if needed. He tried to defend himself with similar opinions from the Convention. Prosecutor Tinville did not care for such explanations and his fiery speech convinced the deputies to <a name="10" class="hidden">dismiss him</a>. Now he is trying to convince the Judge to impose an additional punishment.
$FAB_012_OnStart_00
The defendant may introduce himself.
$FAB_012_OnStart_01
We all know who this villain is.
$FAB_012_OnStart_02
Mathieu Burel, Commander-in-Chief of the National Guard and–
$FAB_012_OnStart_03
Shut up already!
$FAB_012_OnStart_04
Let us proceed directly to the testimony…
$FAB_012_OnGuilty_00
I hereby sentence Mathieu Burel to death by guillotine!
$FAB_012_OnGuilty_01
The souls of the victims may now rest in peace.
$FAB_012_OnGuilty_02
Let him share the fate of those he shot!
$FAB_012_OnPrison_00
I hereby sentence Mathieu Burel to prison! May the convict ponder his actions.
$FAB_012_OnPrison_01
He murdered so many, and what? That’s it?
$FAB_012_OnPrison_02
The lives of 34 people mean less to you than that of a former commander-in-chief?
$FAB_012_OnNotGuilty_00
I hereby declare Mathieu Burel not guilty!
$FAB_012_OnNotGuilty_01
Is he drunk?
$FAB_012_OnNotGuilty_02
Has someone bewitched this quill-driver? He’s talking gibberish!
$FAB_012_OnNotGuilty_03
Freedom for a mass murderer?
$FAB_012_01x02_00_QTitle
Is the condemned aware of the severity of the charges? You understand that 34 Citizens were killed…
$FAB_012_01x02_00_00
Is the condemned aware of the severity of the charges? You understand that 34 Citizens were killed…
$FAB_012_01x02_00_01
Those that were killed were aggressors who dared to attack a soldier.
$FAB_012_01x02_00_02
All 34 of them?
$FAB_012_01x02_00_03
No, he was hit by a rock thrown by a single person, but before that another rock flew over my head. I had reason to believe that the mob would become violent.
$FAB_012_01x02_00_04
But that’s exactly why you were sent there. To prevent violence.
$FAB_012_01x02_00_05
And I did. Several people died, but the rest of the Citizens are safe.
$FAB_012_01x02_00_06
This commander-in-chief is a real piece of work…
$FAB_012_01x02_00_07
He’s not commander-in-chief any more. Still a bastard though…
$FAB_012_01x04_01_QTitle
Summon the witness.
$FAB_012_01x04_01_00
Summon the witness.
$FAB_012_01x04_01_02
Please introduce yourself.
$FAB_012_01x04_01_03
Blaise Fossett, monsieur le juge. I’m a simple blacksmith.
$FAB_012_01x04_01_04
Citizen, do you confirm being a witness of the events that are the cause of our gathering today?
$FAB_012_01x04_01_05
Yes, I was a witness… I mean, I was there. I saw everything and I want to talk about it. I really do.
$FAB_012_02x07_02_QTitle
Does the accused not think that the order to load muskets…?
$FAB_012_02x07_02_00
Does the accused not think that the order to load muskets may have been issued too early?
$FAB_012_02x07_02_01
Why?
$FAB_012_02x07_02_02
Because it could have further aggravated the crowd that was already outraged?
$FAB_012_02x07_02_03
The people of Paris have an ugly history of impaling heads on pikes. I had a sizeable mob before me that was quite obviously ready to attack us at any moment. No, the order was not issued too early. More than that, we should have started shooting as soon as we arrived instead of wasting our time trying to calm them down.
$FAB_012_02x07_02_04
So you believe in brute force rather than diplomacy?
$FAB_012_02x07_02_05
If diplomacy had any chance of success in this situation, deputies of the Convention would have been sent instead of the Guard. Yet, not one of them decided to show up.
$FAB_012_02x07_02_06
I wonder why?
$FAB_012_02x10_03_QTitle
Were you given a reason for your dismissal?
$FAB_012_02x10_03_00
Were you given a reason for your dismissal?
$FAB_012_02x10_03_01
Multiple reasons. I will not address all of them, but the one that wounded me the most was my supposed incompetence.
$FAB_012_02x10_03_02
You caused the death of…
$FAB_012_02x10_03_03
Many people have died during the Revolution. And yet the murderers are members of the Convention… or judges of the tribunals.
$FAB_012_02x10_03_04
The accused should choose his words more carefully. That is slander! A tool of the Monarchist machine!
$FAB_012_02x10_03_05
Spare me your speeches. If you had any decency left in you, you would remain silent.
$FAB_012_02x10_03_06
If we let you go, would you go back to your duty?
$FAB_012_02x10_03_07
No. Now I can see that being a scapegoat is the best I could have hoped for here. A deputy or a judge makes a mistake, so they convict a soldier. That is how it has always been and how it will always be.
$FAB_012_02x10_03_08
Let’s behead a politician!
$FAB_012_03x05_04_QTitle
Why did the Citizen stand between the fighting groups?
$FAB_012_03x05_04_00
Why did the Citizen stand between the fighting groups?
$FAB_012_03x05_04_01
I know for a fact that you can decrease tension with reason and mediation of a third party. I was not involved with either of the groups…
$FAB_012_03x05_04_02
Wait… Do you mean to say you are not a supporter of the Revolution?
$FAB_012_03x05_04_03
During these events, I was a soldier and an officer first and foremost. I could not allow myself the comfort of having political views.
$FAB_012_03x05_04_04
Why?
$FAB_012_03x05_04_05
The security of the people was the most important thing. Citizens from surrounding houses first, protesters second.
$FAB_012_03x05_04_06
Since we are far beyond those events, I take this lack of a clear answer as evidence of your support for the monarchy!
$FAB_012_03x05_04_07
I’ve always remained loyal to France and her people.
$FAB_012_03x06_05_QTitle
What words did you use when addressing the crowd?
$FAB_012_03x06_05_00
What words did you use when addressing the crowd?
$FAB_012_03x06_05_01
I asked them for a moment of silence, then when they were quiet, why they were fighting. That’s when the peace ended and both sides started throwing accusations.
$FAB_012_03x06_05_02
Maybe you shouldn’t have intervened? Maybe you only agitated the crowd more?
$FAB_012_03x06_05_03
How? By asking for a moment of silence?
$FAB_012_03x06_05_04
Did you say anything else?
$FAB_012_03x06_05_05
I was trying to shout over the crowd. Someone accused me of being a spy trying to silence them and suppress their freedom of speech.
$FAB_012_03x06_05_06
Was that your aim?
$FAB_012_03x06_05_07
My aim was to prevent bloodshed. As you can see, it was impossible.
$FAB_012_04x08_06_QTitle
How was one of your soldiers injured?
$FAB_012_04x08_06_00
How was one of your soldiers injured?
$FAB_012_04x08_06_01
He was hit in the chest with a rock. He fell, and for a moment could not catch his breath.
$FAB_012_04x08_06_02
Did you try to calm the crowd after the incident?
$FAB_012_04x08_06_03
Prosecutor, you must be joking…
$FAB_012_04x08_06_04
Why do you say that?
$FAB_012_04x08_06_05
They wanted blood. Their own or ours, it did not matter, they just wanted it spilled.
$FAB_012_04x08_06_06
And you gave them what they wanted?
$FAB_012_04x08_06_07
I had good reason and a document in my hand. I was also responsible for the lives of my subordinates.
$FAB_012_04x08_06_08
You chose to take people’s lives. Did that document come from God?
$FAB_012_05x07_07_QTitle
Do you see yourself as a reckless commander?
$FAB_012_05x07_07_00
Do you see yourself as a reckless commander?
$FAB_012_05x07_07_01
No. I think I am calm most of the time. It comes with age and experience.
$FAB_012_05x07_07_02
Yet you stood between two hostile groups without any guards. That indicates something quite different.
$FAB_012_05x07_07_03
That is called bravery. I would not send a regular soldier. I risked my own life, and also hoped that seeing a high-ranking officer would make them come to their senses.
$FAB_012_05x07_07_04
So it did not work?
$FAB_012_05x07_07_05
No, it had the opposite effect. There is no way I could have expected the outcome.
$FAB_012_05x07_07_06
But you were there to expect exactly such an outcome!
$FAB_012_06x09_08_QTitle
During your arrest you said that you were given official documents issued by…
$FAB_012_06x09_08_00
During your arrest you said that you were given official documents issued by…
$FAB_012_06x09_08_01
Monsieur le juge, may I interrupt? That line of defence is pure nonsense!
$FAB_012_06x09_08_02
Why is that? I brought the document myself to be signed by this judge. He signed it. He gave me the right to use force in the case of immediate danger from the protesters.
$FAB_012_06x09_08_03
You killed 34 people!
$FAB_012_06x09_08_04
Would you rather there were hundreds of dead soldiers and protesters, with the rest of them still fighting each other? I had good reason to use force, and the fact that I am standing here accused only confirms that the Judge present here, and the deputies of the Convention, are merely looking for a scapegoat!
$FAB_012_06x09_08_05
Nonsense, the Convention would never…
$FAB_012_06x09_08_06
Here is the document signed by Judge Alexis Fidèle and the Head of the Tribunal, Raymond Dévoyé. Two judges confirmed my right to use weapons!
$FAB_012_06x09_08_07
It was a recommendation for the Convention, so they could write up such law!
$FAB_012_06x09_08_08
And I recommend that you release me, and sentence these judges to death instead!
$FAB_012_06x09_08_09
He’s right, you know…
$FAB_012_WIT_00_A_QTitle
Please tell us if you saw exactly how the accused acted…
$FAB_012_WIT_00_A_00
Please tell us if you saw exactly how the accused acted during these events.
$FAB_012_WIT_00_A_01
Yes, of course, that’s why I’m here. I saw it. The Captain… He’s a Captain, right?
$FAB_012_WIT_00_A_02
Go on…
$FAB_012_WIT_00_A_03
He stood between the people and started yelling at them. If someone came up to him, he pushed them away and made threats, shaking his fist. But I think he meant well.
$FAB_012_WIT_00_A_04
Why do you think that?
$FAB_012_WIT_00_A_05
I don't know, just a feeling I had.
$FAB_012_WIT_00_B_QTitle
Can the accused recall what the people from both sides were saying?
$FAB_012_WIT_00_B_00
Can the accused recall what the people from both sides were saying?
$FAB_012_WIT_00_B_01
I’d rather not.
$FAB_012_WIT_00_B_02
Why?
$FAB_012_WIT_00_B_03
Because they were vulgar, monsieur de juge. They spewed curses at Robespierre, at Citizen Capet… I’d say these accusations were false.
$FAB_012_WIT_00_B_04
Please give us an example, so we may understand their nature…
$FAB_012_WIT_00_B_05
“Goatfucker”, “bedswerver”, “dalcop”. That’s what they said about the commander-in-chief. They also said Citizen Capet was…
$FAB_012_WIT_00_B_06
Enough.
$FAB_012_WIT_01_A_QTitle
Who attacked first: the crowd or the Guard?
$FAB_012_WIT_01_A_00
Who attacked first: the crowd or the Guard?
$FAB_012_WIT_01_A_01
I’d say the crowd. They threw something at that poor soldier.
$FAB_012_WIT_01_A_02
And after that?
$FAB_012_WIT_01_A_03
Well, they started shooting.
$FAB_012_WIT_01_A_04
Wait… There was no order?
$FAB_012_WIT_01_A_05
I didn’t hear any orders. It was loud and it all happened so fast.
$FAB_012_WIT_01_B_QTitle
What did the accused do when the first bodies fell?
$FAB_012_WIT_01_B_00
What did the accused do when the first bodies fell?
$FAB_012_WIT_01_B_01
Oh, he wasn’t very nice. Not nice at all.
$FAB_012_WIT_01_B_02
Can you be a bit more precise?
$FAB_012_WIT_01_B_03
He told his people to leave and then spat in the direction of the crowd and the bodies there.
