Bruno Hugo, 26, is a groom working for the wealthy and influential aristocrat, Jean-Claude de Jacquemard. During a quarrel, he was seen to push his employer down the stairs, resulting in the aristocrat’s death. It is significant for the case that, due to his origin and low intellect, Bruno Hugo is known in the local community as <a name="2" class="hidden">“village idiot”</a>.
$GEN_008_DOC_01_01
The witnesses testified that Jacquemard <a name="3" class="hidden">returned from a ride</a> displeased with the way Bruno had prepared his horse. Apparently, the saddle had become so <a name="4" class="hidden">loose</a> that Citizen de Jacquemard almost fell from his mount.
$GEN_008_DOC_01_02
The victim called for Bruno in order to scold him, and began <a name="5" class="hidden">insulting and physically abusing the stable boy</a>, when, acting on an impulse, Bruno pushed his employer away. As a result, Citizen de Jacquemard landed at the foot of the stairs <a name="7" class="hidden">with a twisted neck</a>. The incident happened in front of other employees. Bruno Hugo escaped to the stable, where he was later found, pale with fright and whispering something to one of the horses.

This is a simple case. The accused is guilty of murder and the only problem is that people feel sorry for him.
$GEN_008_OnStart_01
What is your name?
$GEN_008_OnStart_02
Bruno Hugo... I'm Bruno Hugo.
$GEN_008_OnStart_03
Did you work for Citizen Jean-Claude de Jacquemard?
$GEN_008_OnStart_04
Yes, I worked there for a few years… quite a few.
$GEN_008_OnStart_05
Leave him alone, he’s just a man-child.
$GEN_008_OnStart_06
Do you admit to the murder? Yes or no?
$GEN_008_OnStart_07
But I...
$GEN_008_OnStart_08
Poor thing, he’s shaking all over.
$GEN_008_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Citizen Hugo to the guillotine.
$GEN_008_OnGuilty_01
Poor fool…
$GEN_008_OnGuilty_02
He didn’t even know what happened.
$GEN_008_OnGuilty_03
Well, at least he will not kill anyone else.
$GEN_008_OnPrison_00
I sentence Citizen Bruno Hugo to prison for causing an accident that led to Citizen Jean-Claude de Jacquemard’s death.
$GEN_008_OnPrison_01
Prison is like death for this man!
$GEN_008_OnPrison_02
You were too lenient, he played you.
$GEN_008_OnNotGuilty_00
I find Bruno Hugo not guilty of the aforementioned crimes as he is unaware of what happened.
$GEN_008_OnNotGuilty_01
What does it matter? A crime is a crime!
$GEN_008_OnNotGuilty_02
You have to be careful with the likes of this one – his employer should’ve known better.

Do you know how local people refer to you?

Do you know how local people refer to you?
$GEN_008_01x02_00_01
Bruno does not know. Does not know.
$GEN_008_01x02_00_02
“Village idiot.” Do you wish to comment on this?
$GEN_008_01x02_00_03
Bruno does not like that name… no.
$GEN_008_01x02_00_04
Do they often call you that?
$GEN_008_01x02_00_05
The court is mocking him!
$GEN_008_01x02_00_06
I don’t like it and that’s that. I already have a name given to me by mother. She gave me one.
$GEN_008_01x02_00_07
Was this nickname the reason you pushed Citizen de Jacquard down the stairs?
$GEN_008_01x02_00_08
The master was shouting and I don’t like it when he shouts. I don’t like it.
$GEN_008_01x04_01_QTitle
As a stable boy, were you responsible for preparing horses for the victim?
$GEN_008_01x04_01_00
As a stable boy, were you responsible for preparing horses for the victim?
$GEN_008_01x04_01_01
Yes. I combed them and fed them. Horses eat a lot of grass… I combed them.
$GEN_008_01x04_01_02
Was the saddle loose?
$GEN_008_01x04_01_03
…
$GEN_008_01x04_01_04
Citizen?
$GEN_008_01x04_01_05
No, impossible. I pulled the straps. You can’t pull too hard, or it crushes and hurts the horse’s stomach. Horses are good, better than humans, they–
$GEN_008_01x04_01_06
Did you want your master to fall off the horse? Did you deliberately leave the girth strap loose to get back at your employer?
$GEN_008_01x04_01_07
I’d never! I liked our master, wouldn’t hurt him. I liked him.
$GEN_008_01x04_01_08
You can see that he’s a gentle child.
$GEN_008_01x05_02_QTitle
How did Citizen de Jacquemard treat you?

How did Citizen de Jacquemard treat you?
$GEN_008_01x05_02_01
He was good to me… Sometimes he shouted, but he fed me and was good to the horses. Good.
$GEN_008_01x05_02_02
How often did he shout?
$GEN_008_01x05_02_03
Sometimes he shouted… Sometimes he didn’t.
$GEN_008_01x05_02_04
Aristocrat scoundrel!
$GEN_008_01x05_02_05
Is that why you decided to kill him?
$GEN_008_01x05_02_06
…
$GEN_008_01x05_02_07
First he was tormented by the nobleman, and now by the Revolution.

My name is Colin Boufue, I am the major-domo at the residence of the de Jacquemard family. I saw exactly what happened.

Are you aware that you have killed a man? Do you understand that?
$GEN_008_05x06_04_00
Are you aware that you have killed a man? Do you understand that?
$GEN_008_05x06_04_01
I know… I just swung my arm because he was shouting at me like that. So loud.
$GEN_008_05x06_04_02
Were you aware that you could hurt him?
$GEN_008_05x06_04_03
I didn’t think so. I didn’t.
$GEN_008_05x06_04_04
Did you swing so hard he fell down?
$GEN_008_05x06_04_05
I got so scared, I can't remember. I squinted my eyes, sir, and when I opened them again, there he was, lying down there... Downstairs.
$GEN_008_06x07_05_QTitle
Do you plead guilty?
$GEN_008_06x07_05_00
Do you plead guilty?
$GEN_008_06x07_05_01
I don’t know what I did wrong. I don’t understand. These people wanted me to come here, so I came… I meant no harm to nobody… No harm.
$GEN_008_06x07_05_02
You are facing the death penalty for murder. Do you realise that?
$GEN_008_06x07_05_03
I just want to go back to the horses. I don’t know if they’ve eaten today. If a horse doesn’t eat for a long time… The master isn’t happy when the horses aren’t fed.
$GEN_008_06x07_05_04
Are you more worried about the horses than about your master?
$GEN_008_06x07_05_05
The master is dead, what can I do? And the horses are still alive. They’re alive.

Please tell us what happened between Citizen Hugo and the master of the house on that unfortunate day.
$GEN_008_WIT_00_A_01
Citizen de Jacquemard was furious at Bruno because he hadn’t tightened the saddle. It could have caused an accident.
$GEN_008_WIT_00_A_02
How did your employer react to this?
$GEN_008_WIT_00_A_03
He started shouting at Bruno, tugging and pulling at him. Bruno pushed Citizen de Jacquemard away, causing him to fall down the stairs they were both standing on.
$GEN_008_WIT_00_A_04
Nasty bourgeois…

What do you think of the groom?
$GEN_008_WIT_00_B_00
What do you think of the groom?
$GEN_008_WIT_00_B_01
He’s a good worker, although he does have some… limitations. I don’t think there’s anything else I can add. Nobody thought he could be dangerous.
$GEN_008_WIT_00_B_02
Limitations? But he was aware of what was going on around him?
$GEN_008_WIT_00_B_03
Yes, he’s just… he’s just a little slow to understand.
$GEN_008_WIT_00_B_04
So you are convinced of his guilt?
$GEN_008_WIT_00_B_05
Yes, I saw everything. He caused the master’s death.
