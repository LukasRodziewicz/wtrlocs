In the dock sits Michał Trandowski of Poland, a 44-year-old deserter who, for reasons unknown, has abandoned his troops and left them fighting against the forces of Catherine II. He crossed the French border and then moved to Paris, and we believe that he intended to commit a politically motivated murder in the Convention.
$GEN_012_DOC_01_01
His intentions behind the assault are not clear, although witnesses suggest that the attack was aimed at <a name="4" class="hidden">Maximilien Robespierre</a>.
$GEN_012_DOC_01_02
Trandowski managed to join a session in the Convention and, somehow, was even able to carry a dagger inside. The attack took place in the corridor during a break. The Pole reached for the knife and jumped at Robespierre. There is no doubt the attack would have ended tragically if it was not for <a name="5" class="hidden">Cécile de Jarre</a>, an associate of the target. His hand was injured during the scuffle, but his sacrifice allowed other people to restrain the madman.
$GEN_012_DOC_01_03
Michał Trandowski was detained by the Guard and brought before the Court, where he will have to answer for <a name="6" class="hidden">attempted political assassination</a>, which is equivalent to acting against France.
$GEN_012_DOC_01_04
Trandowski served for some time in the Revolutionary Army. We managed to find his superiors, who praised him for his <a name="7" class="hidden">impeccable service</a> and honourable attitude. We also talked to his comrades, and they claimed that the defendant deeply <a name="8" class="hidden">missed</a> his homeland and constantly worried about its future.

Show them that France will cut off every foreign hand that dares threaten its leaders.
$GEN_012_OnStart_01
Name, surname, and occupation?
$GEN_012_OnStart_02
Michał Trandowski. I’m a soldier. I served in the French Army.
$GEN_012_OnStart_03
Do you come from Poland?
$GEN_012_OnStart_04
Yes, many of us serve in your army.
$GEN_012_OnStart_05
We don’t need soldiers like him!
$GEN_012_OnStart_06
Oh? Wait until you see the Prussian bayonets.
$GEN_012_OnStart_07
Do you really think that you can defend France? You were not even able to defend your own country!
$GEN_012_OnStart_08
Do you wish to find out? I challenge you to a duel with sabres!
$GEN_012_OnStart_09
Silence!
$GEN_012_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Citizen Michał Trandowski to the guillotine.
$GEN_012_OnGuilty_01
We will all sleep better.
$GEN_012_OnGuilty_02
That’s what happens to traitors!
$GEN_012_OnGuilty_03
And deserters!
$GEN_012_OnPrison_00
I sentence Citizen Michał Trandowski to prison! Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_012_OnPrison_01
Wait, what?!
$GEN_012_OnPrison_02
He spared a would-be murderer?
$GEN_012_OnPrison_03
I hope the other prisoners know how to deal with him.
$GEN_012_OnNotGuilty_00
I find Michał Trandowski not guilty. He was blinded and inspired by a higher purpose.
$GEN_012_OnNotGuilty_01
Who knows when that “higher purpose” will make him attack again…
$GEN_012_OnNotGuilty_02
The soldier admitted to everything, and he lets him go?!
$GEN_012_OnNotGuilty_03
This isn’t a court, it’s a cabaret!
$GEN_012_03x04_00_QTitle
Why did you try to kill Robespierre?
$GEN_012_03x04_00_00
Why did you try to kill Robespierre?
$GEN_012_03x04_00_01
Because France turned its back on us.
$GEN_012_03x04_00_02
Us?
$GEN_012_03x04_00_03
Poland. We fight for you while our homeland is being torn to pieces. Soon it will disappear from the map, yet you do nothing!
$GEN_012_03x04_00_04
What would you have France do?
$GEN_012_03x04_00_05
You could help us. It’s in your best interest. You had a Polish Queen! But you refused to help, and now Russia and Prussia have joined together to plunder my homeland.
$GEN_012_03x04_00_06
That is a very subjective view, Mr Trandowski.
$GEN_012_03x04_00_07
There’s nothing subjective about honour! At least for me. You Frenchmen seem to think differently, and there’s no Revolution which will change that.
$GEN_012_03x04_00_08
Was it honour that inspired you to attack a defenceless man with a knife?
$GEN_012_03x04_00_09
Robespierre has the blood of my compatriots on his hands.
$GEN_012_03x04_00_10
He’s delirious, probably drunk on vodka.
$GEN_012_01x06_01_QTitle
Are you aware that you attempted to carry out a political assassination?
$GEN_012_01x06_01_00
Are you aware that you attempted to carry out a political assassination?
$GEN_012_01x06_01_01
Yes, and I don’t regret a thing. I am ready to accept the consequences of my deed.
$GEN_012_01x06_01_02
Do you have anything to say to defend your actions?
$GEN_012_01x06_01_03
Don’t waste your time on him.
$GEN_012_01x06_01_04
I didn’t come here to defend myself. I came to say, before everyone in this room, that Europe sits idly by while my country is dying. It’s all that I can do now.
$GEN_012_01x06_01_05
Do you believe that the death of Robespierre would have improved the situation of Poland?
$GEN_012_01x06_01_06
…
$GEN_012_01x06_01_07
I think that you want revenge, but are too much of a coward to attack the Russians or the Prussians.
$GEN_012_05x09_02_QTitle
You injured an innocent man. Were you intending to kill?
$GEN_012_05x09_02_00
You injured an innocent man. Were you intending to kill?
$GEN_012_05x09_02_01
I wanted to bring the attention of France, and the whole world, to the difficulties faced by Poland.
$GEN_012_05x09_02_02
You attacked one of the leaders of the Revolution with a dagger.
$GEN_012_05x09_02_03
I’ve killed at least a dozen Moscovites for my dear country. One more, one less, who cares? I might as well kill Robespierre!
$GEN_012_05x09_02_04
That man is insane!
$GEN_012_05x09_02_05
So you admit to your guilt?
$GEN_012_05x09_02_06
Yes, I wanted to kill him. If the death of Maximilien Robespierre would harm the Revolution and make France notice my troubled Poland, I would kill him without hesitation.
$GEN_012_05x09_02_07
I have nothing more to add. He is incriminating himself more and more with each sentence.
$GEN_012_04x09_03_QTitle
Call in the witness, Cécile de Jarre.
$GEN_012_04x09_03_00
Call in the witness, Cécile de Jarre.
$GEN_012_04x09_03_02
Please introduce yourself.
$GEN_012_04x09_03_03
Cécile de Jarre, I am an associate of Maximilien Robespierre.
$GEN_012_02x06_04_QTitle
Were you planning to murder Robespierre when you were on your way to France?
$GEN_012_02x06_04_00
Were you planning to murder Robespierre when you were on your way to France?
$GEN_012_02x06_04_01
I wanted to serve in your army and fight against Russia.
$GEN_012_02x06_04_02
France is not at war with Russia.
$GEN_012_02x06_04_03
Not yet. That’s why I decided to help Poland in a different way.
$GEN_012_02x06_04_04
So you dreamed of dragging France into a war with Russia?
$GEN_012_02x06_04_05
Wouldn’t that be wonderful?
$GEN_012_02x06_04_06
There would be thousands of casualties and innocent victims, and you think that would be wonderful?
$GEN_012_02x06_04_07
A true madman!
$GEN_012_02x06_04_08
You believe that the death of Robespierre would make France join your war?
$GEN_012_02x06_04_09
If I had succeeded, the world would start talking about us.
$GEN_012_03x09_05_QTitle
Why did you use a dagger?
$GEN_012_03x09_05_00
Why did you use a dagger?
$GEN_012_03x09_05_01
It’s easier to hide a dagger than a sabre, and you can rely on it. Pistols tend to break when you really need them.
$GEN_012_03x09_05_02
You wanted to be sure that your victim would not survive?
$GEN_012_03x09_05_03
When I am on a mission, I do my best to fulfil it.
$GEN_012_03x09_05_04
A man like that… walking freely on the streets!
$GEN_012_03x05_06_QTitle
Did you know Cécile de Jarre prior to the incident?
$GEN_012_03x05_06_00
Did you know Cécile de Jarre prior to the incident?
$GEN_012_03x05_06_01
No. I saw him for the first time when he stood in my way.
$GEN_012_03x05_06_02
And you struck anyway? Aiming at an innocent man?
$GEN_012_03x05_06_03
He stood in my way. It just happened.
$GEN_012_03x05_06_04
Beast! Savage!
$GEN_012_06x07_07_QTitle
Your comrades testified that your military service was without fault.
$GEN_012_06x07_07_00
Your comrades testified that your military service was without fault. Why ruin such a perfect career?
$GEN_012_06x07_07_01
I would sacrifice not only my career, but my life for my beloved Commonwealth.
$GEN_012_06x07_07_02
And you will soon enough!
$GEN_012_06x07_07_03
Did you take an oath to serve the Republic?
$GEN_012_06x07_07_04
No oath is superior to the one sworn to your country.
$GEN_012_01x08_08_QTitle
If you are so attached to your own country, why did you serve in a foreign army?
$GEN_012_01x08_08_00
If you are so attached to your own country, why did you serve in a foreign army?
$GEN_012_01x08_08_01
I believed that France’s victory over Prussia and Austria would help the Commonwealth. Many of us still believe that France is our only hope.
$GEN_012_01x08_08_02
So you wanted to weaken us by attacking one of our leaders?
$GEN_012_01x08_08_03
Some sacrifices are necessary.
$GEN_012_01x08_08_04
Why don’t you sacrifice yourself?
$GEN_012_01x08_08_05
I already have.
$GEN_012_WIT_00_A_QTitle
Describe the attack in the Convention.
$GEN_012_WIT_00_A_00
Describe the attack in the Convention.
$GEN_012_WIT_00_A_01
We left the boardroom and continued the discussion. Citizen Robespierre was walking by my side and telling me something when I noticed a man running straight at us.
$GEN_012_WIT_00_A_02
What did you do?
$GEN_012_WIT_00_A_03
I tried to grab him, but he cut my hand. Luckily, the corridor was crowded with people and they quickly pulled him away from me.
$GEN_012_WIT_00_A_04
In other words, Trandowski attacked an innocent man by surprise.
$GEN_012_WIT_00_A_05
Exactly.
$GEN_012_WIT_00_A_06
Did Mr Trandowski say anything? Could you describe his behaviour?
$GEN_012_WIT_00_A_07
He looked furious and was talking to himself.
$GEN_012_WIT_00_A_08
What exactly did you hear?
$GEN_012_WIT_00_A_09
He was speaking in a foreign language. I think he repeated a few words, but I didn’t understand them.
$GEN_012_WIT_01_A_QTitle
Do you think he planned the attack?
$GEN_012_WIT_01_A_00
Do you think he planned the attack?
$GEN_012_WIT_01_A_01
I believe so.
$GEN_012_WIT_01_A_02
Looks like he didn’t plan it well.
$GEN_012_WIT_01_A_03
What makes you think that?
$GEN_012_WIT_01_A_04
He must have established that Robespierre would be present in the building, and had to find a way to enter with a weapon. Then he just needed to wait for some commotion before attacking his target.

How did the defendant’s superiors evaluate his service?
$GEN_012_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_00_00
It was without fault.

The defendant was allegedly clumsy and cowardly.
$GEN_012_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_00_01
He did not stand out from other soldiers.
