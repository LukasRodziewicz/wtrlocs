The defendant is Charlotte Corday, residing in Caen, she openly declares her <a name="1" class="hidden">sympathy for the Girondins</a>. The woman murdered Jean-Paul Marat – she was detained at the scene of the crime and confessed immediately.
$FAB_019_DOC_01_01
According to our information, the woman displays an intense dislike of the Jacobins and anyone who contributed to the fall of the Girondins. She arranged a meeting with Marat under the pretext of <a name="2" class="hidden">turning in a group of her comrades</a> who had supposedly planned an uprising in Caen. Marat’s servants remained vigilant and initially did not let the woman near Jean-Paul, but allegedly the host reprimanded them and told them to let the supposed informer in. The man was sitting in his bath, as rumour had it he suffered from a skin disease that was eased by long baths. It seems he suspected nothing, as we found none of the deceased’s weapons near the bathtub.
$FAB_019_DOC_01_02
After a short conversation, Corday <a name="4" class="hidden">thrust a knife</a> between his ribs. Marat cried for help, but had little chance of surviving after being so badly wounded. When the servants ran in, Corday was standing at the window, looking out as though she were examining the landscape. She offered no resistance during her arrest, but tightly gripped a copy of Plutarch’s “Parallel Lives” – I do not know if it is any good, I have not read it. On the way to her cell, she repeated many times that she had been <a name="6" class="hidden">acting on her own</a>, and was particularly keen on emphasising that there was no man behind her act. The guards probably did not fully believe her, as she began to shout in the corridor that she was a virgin. Yet, who would want to copulate with a lunatic like her? Marat is dead.

Jean-Paul Marat
$FAB_019_DOC_02_01
He was our brother, one of the informal leaders of the Revolution. Everyone loved him for his apt articles in which he highlighted the faults of the enemies to revival. Perhaps he was too sharp with his conclusions, but could he have been otherwise?
$FAB_019_DOC_02_02
Evidence:
$FAB_019_DOC_02_03
A knife with dried blood on the blade, and <a name="7" class="hidden">a copy of “Parallel Lives” by Plutarch</a>.
$FAB_019_OnStart_00
Traitor!
$FAB_019_OnStart_01
You will rot, bitch!
$FAB_019_OnStart_02
Please introduce yourself.
$FAB_019_OnStart_03
My name is Charlotte Corday.
$FAB_019_OnStart_04
You have been accused of murdering Citizen Marat–
$FAB_019_OnStart_05
Yes, I did it.
$FAB_019_OnStart_06
We rarely see people here confess so willingly.
$FAB_019_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Citizen Charlotte Corday to be guillotined! Lead the condemned out.
$FAB_019_OnGuilty_01
That’s right!
$FAB_019_OnGuilty_02
Yes, drag the pig out for slaughter!
$FAB_019_OnNotGuilty_00
The verdict in the case of Citizen Marat’s murder is… not guilty! Please release Miss Corday.
$FAB_019_OnNotGuilty_01
Has the Judge gone mad?
$FAB_019_OnNotGuilty_02
Paris will not forget you for this.
$FAB_019_01x02_00_QTitle
Do you want to turn in your companions?
$FAB_019_01x02_00_00
Do you want to turn in your companions?
$FAB_019_01x02_00_01
There were no companions, as there was no uprising. I knew that the vision of a big conspiracy would convince Marat to meet with me.
$FAB_019_01x02_00_02
She’s one shrewd bitch.
$FAB_019_01x02_00_03
You came from Caen? That’s a long way from Paris…
$FAB_019_01x02_00_04
The journey passed quickly, as I was focused on its purpose and the pleasure of imagining Marat as a bleeding creature.
$FAB_019_01x02_00_05
You made sure to wear a beautiful outfit as well…
$FAB_019_01x02_00_06
A beautiful outfit for the guillotine, not for Marat.
$FAB_019_01x02_00_07
You are acting as if you want to die.
$FAB_019_01x02_00_08
Such is the price of freedom and equality. I at least agree with Marat on one point – the change that is necessary for France must be introduced by force. I added my unswerving strength of will to that end.
$FAB_019_01x06_01_QTitle
Are we supposed to believe that you acted on your own?
$FAB_019_01x06_01_00
Are we supposed to believe that you acted on your own?
$FAB_019_01x06_01_01
It doesn’t take a regiment of soldiers to stab someone with a knife.
$FAB_019_01x06_01_02
And nobody helped to plan it? You made it particularly clear–
$FAB_019_01x06_01_03
I will say this loud and clear – I am aware that monsieur le juge had a dispute with Marat, but let everyone here know that I was not instructed to do this by Judge Fidèle.
$FAB_019_01x06_01_04
All those coincidences…
$FAB_019_01x06_01_05
I don’t need a man to administer justice. I don’t need a man to do anything. My own strong will is sufficient.
$FAB_019_01x06_01_06
Why did you underline–
$FAB_019_01x06_01_07
Because your minds are unable to accept the idea that a delicate woman could kill. Marat was the same.
$FAB_019_02x04_02_QTitle
What you have done is a blow to all of France. Marat was an outstanding Citizen of Paris…
$FAB_019_02x04_02_00
What you have done is a blow to all of France. Marat was an outstanding Citizen of Paris, devoted to the Revolution–
$FAB_019_02x04_02_01
He was scum! A monster! Only in Paris could someone like him be respected as the saviour of the nation. To us in Caen, and for many people across France, he was and will always be an ordinary criminal.
$FAB_019_02x04_02_02
And also for those companions whom you intended to turn in?
$FAB_019_02x04_02_03
Do you think anyone will tell you the truth? You, the people who feed the guillotine with fresh blood?
$FAB_019_02x04_02_04
The transparent actions of the authorities were to be the foundation of the Revolution.
$FAB_019_02x04_02_05
Perhaps in Paris, but in the countryside it is now worse than before. We used to blame the King for our hunger, and now we blame ourselves because it was us who put you in power.
$FAB_019_02x04_02_06
A blood-stained knife was found at the scene of the crime. Is it yours?
$FAB_019_02x04_02_07
Yes, I bought it not long before. Anyone who is secretly against another could administer such a blow. With an ordinary knife, and no need for the performance you give every day on the guillotine.
$FAB_019_03x04_03_QTitle
Killing a statesman in the bath is an insult to the country.
$FAB_019_03x04_03_00
Killing a statesman in the bath is an insult to the country.
$FAB_019_03x04_03_01
Was I supposed to wait for him to put his breeches on?
$FAB_019_03x04_03_02
You are talking about a great man here!
$FAB_019_03x04_03_03
To me he was merely a small man pumped up with arrogance. I actually find this whole situation quite symbolic.
$FAB_019_03x04_03_04
Why?
$FAB_019_03x04_03_05
He was so defenceless. He suspected nothing, he had no weapons – just like the victims of his defamatory articles.
$FAB_019_03x04_03_06
Marat only told the truth…
$FAB_019_03x04_03_07
I’ve heard rumours that he got a skin disease from hiding in the sewers of Paris. He came out like a rat to die in his own shit.
$FAB_019_03x04_03_08
That is quite enough.
$FAB_019_03x04_03_09
The guillotine will embrace you, just wait and see!
$FAB_019_04x06_04_QTitle
Why are you so hateful towards Marat?
$FAB_019_04x06_04_00
Why are you so hateful towards Marat?
$FAB_019_04x06_04_01
He was a symbol of the evil that is smothering my country.
$FAB_019_04x06_04_02
Is that why you stayed there after committing the crime?
$FAB_019_04x06_04_03
I am not ashamed, I do not have to run. I have killed one man to save one hundred thousand, and I will receive death as my reward.
$FAB_019_04x06_04_04
The fall of the Girondins was justified.
$FAB_019_04x06_04_05
That’s a lie! The fall of the Girondins was planned. You issued your verdict, and probably had a hand in the whole thing!
$FAB_019_04x06_04_06
What do you mean?
$FAB_019_04x06_04_07
The judge here was involved in a dispute with Minister Roland. All of a sudden, the Girondins were accused of treason! It’s not hard to figure out that Judge Fidèle must have had something to do with it.
$FAB_019_04x06_04_08
Enough of these aspersions.
$FAB_019_06x07_05_QTitle
When you were arrested, you were holding a book by Plutarch…
$FAB_019_06x07_05_00
When you were arrested, you were holding a book by Plutarch. Can you explain this choice to us?
$FAB_019_06x07_05_01
We know brilliant minds that grew up reading this book, getting to know the ideals described within. It is a beacon to those who have their doubts.
$FAB_019_06x07_05_02
What manner of noble idea justifies the killing of innocent people?
$FAB_019_06x07_05_03
…
$FAB_019_06x07_05_04
Answer the question!
$FAB_019_06x07_05_05
The streets are red with the blood of hundreds of innocent victims, and you are asking me this question because of Marat alone? Ask the other heroes of the Revolution… Oh, that’s right, they’re dead too. They’ve already been killed by the ideal they helped to create.
$FAB_019_06x07_05_06
So this man’s death was justified?
$FAB_019_06x07_05_07
No less than the deaths of those Girondins who had the courage to disagree with you. Marat died so many others could have the chance to live a little longer. What, you surely didn’t think you had a monopoly on brutality?

$FAB_019_UNIQUE_QUESTION_00
What was the murder weapon?
$FAB_019_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_00_00
A knife.
$FAB_019_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_00_00
An axe.
$FAB_019_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_00_01
A bayonet.
$FAB_019_UNIQUE_QUESTION_01
Did the defendant turn in her accomplices?
$FAB_019_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_01_00
She was working alone.
$FAB_019_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_00
They were insurgents from Caen.
$FAB_019_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_01
They were just a group of criminals from Paris.
$FAB_019_UNIQUE_QUESTION_02
Why did the defendant choose Marat?
$FAB_019_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_02_00
In her opinion, he was a symbol of the evil that smothered France.
$FAB_019_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_02_00
He demanded in his paper that her lover be decapitated.
$FAB_019_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_02_01
She chose him randomly.
