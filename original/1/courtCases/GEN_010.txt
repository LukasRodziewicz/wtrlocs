Alfred Renoir is a 43-year-old baker from the northern Parisian suburbs. Renoir has been accused of causing the death of several children from the neighbourhood. The defendant and his wife have two sons and a daughter. Witnesses claim that he is a man of few words, but sympathetic. He would not refuse to sell bread on credit, neither did he ever add sawdust to flour. During the investigation, his house was searched and no Monarchist materials were found.
$GEN_010_DOC_1_01
The lawsuits against the baker were filed by three women that blame him for the death of their children. In total, eight minors were found dead. The cause of death was confirmed by a Parisian doctor as <a name="2" class="hidden">hunger</a>.
$GEN_010_DOC_1_02
A week earlier, those women, together with a small group of neighbours, tried to force the baker to sell them bread – or at least some flour. According to witnesses, there were no more than 15 people standing in front of the bakery.
$GEN_010_DOC_1_03
Renoir <a name="3" class="hidden">categorically refused</a> and threatened to call the Guard. When the hungry people asked him to increase the production of bread, he refused again. On the next day, the three mothers who are now accusing him once again paid him a visit, and once more were not able to buy any bread.
$GEN_010_DOC_1_04
The investigator, assisted by soldiers, found a large supply of flour in the bakery’s stores. It is hard to prove whether the <a name="4" class="hidden">death of the children</a> was caused solely by the baker’s behaviour.
$GEN_010_DOC_1_05
The baker testified that he was buying his flour from a <a name="5" class="hidden">peasant in the countryside</a>. However, nobody has ever seen him in Paris. People are gossiping that he is conspiring with the Austrians. Many believe that the Habsburgs are trying to fight the Revolution by starving the Citizens of Paris .
$GEN_010_DOC_1_06
The accused couldn’t explain his reasoning for not selling bread, and would only say that he didn’t have a choice.

$GEN_010_OnStart_00
Murdering traitor! We want our bread!
$GEN_010_OnStart_01
When hungry and desperate people start discussing possible conspiracies, it is better to stay away from their suspicions.
$GEN_010_OnStart_02
The defendant may introduce himself.
$GEN_010_OnStart_03
My name is Alfred Renoir. I’m a baker.
$GEN_010_OnStart_04
Citizen Renoir, you are accused of causing the death of several children.
$GEN_010_OnStart_05
I didn’t kill anybody. I would never hurt a child.
$GEN_010_OnStart_06
He may not have used a knife, but he is still guilty.
$GEN_010_OnStart_07
Heartless bastard!
$GEN_010_OnGuilty_00
I find Alfred Renoir guilty of the deliberate starvation of the Citizens of Paris and causing the death of children. For those crimes, I sentence him to the guillotine.
$GEN_010_OnGuilty_01
A wise verdict. We are at war, and war calls for ruthless decisions.
$GEN_010_OnGuilty_02
So what? My children are still dead!
$GEN_010_OnGuilty_03
Give his flour to the people!
$GEN_010_OnGuilty_04
Great! The baker will lose his head and our bellies can finally be full!
$GEN_010_OnNotGuilty_00
The defendant has not committed any crime. Please release Citizen Alfred Renoir.
$GEN_010_OnNotGuilty_01
Objection! I demand the defendant be punished!
$GEN_010_OnNotGuilty_02
Your children don’t know hunger, do they Judge?
$GEN_010_OnNotGuilty_03
The judge surely conspires with the Austrians!
$GEN_010_OnNotGuilty_04
We want a different judge!
$GEN_010_01x03_00_QTitle
Is it true that you refused to sell bread to those three women?
$GEN_010_01x03_00_00
Is it true that you refused to sell bread to those three women?
$GEN_010_01x03_00_01
Yes, they came to me asking for bread.
$GEN_010_01x03_00_02
Were they trying to get it for free?
$GEN_010_01x03_00_03
No, they were pushing money into my hands. Even more than they were supposed to.
$GEN_010_01x03_00_04
And he yelled at us!
$GEN_010_01x03_00_05
Did you tell him that you needed it for your children?
$GEN_010_01x03_00_06
Yes, and he still refused.
$GEN_010_01x03_00_07
Have you no conscience?
$GEN_010_01x03_00_08
I asked them politely, yet they wouldn’t leave…
$GEN_010_01x03_00_09
Why did you refuse?
$GEN_010_01x03_00_10
I had no other choice…
$GEN_010_02x06_01_QTitle
Do you know that our country is at war?
$GEN_010_02x06_01_00
Do you know that our country is at war?
$GEN_010_02x06_01_01
Yes, I am aware of that.
$GEN_010_02x06_01_02
Then why did you refuse to help your fellow Citizens? Your actions are a betrayal of the Republic and I can charge you for treason.
$GEN_010_02x06_01_03
Monsieur le juge, do you know that I’m also fighting a personal war?
$GEN_010_02x06_01_04
What war?
$GEN_010_02x06_01_05
One where I’m struggling for the survival of my family. Any other war can wait. I have three children and a wife, and I cannot betray them.
$GEN_010_02x06_01_06
If we lose, every child will be starving.
$GEN_010_02x06_01_07
He sold his soul to the Austrians to give a few breadcrumbs to his whore.
$GEN_010_02x07_02_QTitle
According to the purchase ledger, you had enough bread…
$GEN_010_02x07_02_00
According to the purchase ledger, you had enough bread to sell to those women, and many other clients besides.
$GEN_010_02x07_02_01
I have now, but who knows what will happen soon? Will there be another supply? The true hunger has yet to hit us and I have a family to support. How long will they be forced to survive on my current supplies alone?
$GEN_010_02x07_02_02
We had children too!
$GEN_010_02x07_02_03
You were storing it all for your own use?
$GEN_010_02x07_02_04
For my family, yes. Is that really a crime?
$GEN_010_02x07_02_05
And you were eating every day?
$GEN_010_02x07_02_06
Luckily yes, but I’m not sure how long it will last.
$GEN_010_02x07_02_07
Bastard, did you hear him? Imperial sellout!
$GEN_010_02x04_03_QTitle
Please call in the witness.
$GEN_010_02x04_03_00
Please call in the witness.
$GEN_010_02x04_03_02
Please introduce yourself.
$GEN_010_02x04_03_03
Arnaud Lemout. I examined the children.
$GEN_010_03x04_04_QTitle
These women claim that your refusal was the direct cause…
$GEN_010_03x04_04_00
These women claim that your refusal was the direct cause of their children’s death. What do you say to that?
$GEN_010_03x04_04_01
Was my bread the last scrap of food in Paris? If they wanted to feed their children, they should have tried harder.
$GEN_010_03x04_04_02
He tries to blame those poor women!
$GEN_010_03x04_04_03
A traitorous Austrian spy dares to call me a bad mother?
$GEN_010_03x04_04_04
Are you suggesting this tragedy was due to the negligence of the parents?
$GEN_010_03x04_04_05
I am the father of my own children, not of every child in the neighbourhood.
$GEN_010_03x04_04_06
Your attitude shows that you do not understand the Revolutionary ideal of brotherhood.
$GEN_010_03x04_04_07
Freedom, equality, brotherhood… and a sharp blade to decapitate the bastards!
$GEN_010_03x06_05_QTitle
Are you an Austrian spy?
$GEN_010_03x06_05_00
Are you an Austrian spy?
$GEN_010_03x06_05_01
…
$GEN_010_03x06_05_02
Citizen?
$GEN_010_03x06_05_03
I didn’t reply as I would rather not insult you, monsieur le juge, because the only suitable answer is that whoever made this rubbish up must be an idiot. And I apologise, monsieur le juge, if it was your idea.
$GEN_010_03x06_05_04
Many people are saying that something was amiss.
$GEN_010_03x06_05_05
I can’t even speak their language! Some simpletons have made up this ridiculous accusation because they can’t properly manage their own lives.
$GEN_010_03x06_05_06
Who are you calling simpletons, you selfish bastard?!
$GEN_010_06x05_06_QTitle
How is your flour delivered?
$GEN_010_06x05_06_00
How is your flour delivered?
$GEN_010_06x05_06_01
I collect it myself every Saturday.
$GEN_010_06x05_06_02
So you regularly travel out of town? Does anybody else go with you?
$GEN_010_06x05_06_03
No, why?
$GEN_010_06x05_06_04
Because of the suspicions about you being a spy and conspirator…
$GEN_010_06x05_06_05
Bravo! The judge has exposed the traitor!
$GEN_010_06x05_06_06
Why would it be strange that a baker travels to the countryside once a week to collect flour?
$GEN_010_06x05_06_07
Why would it be strange that someone who regularly travels is recruited as a spy?
$GEN_010_06x05_06_08
That’s absurd.
$GEN_010_06x05_06_09
Call in the witness.
$GEN_010_06x05_06_11
You were the one who traded with the defendant? Please introduce yourself.
$GEN_010_06x05_06_12
Ruttmann is my name, I’m a peasant and a miller. Yes, I traded with him, monsieur le juge. Why not? Did I do something wrong?
$GEN_010_WIT_00_A_QTitle
Could you describe your conclusions after examining the children?
$GEN_010_WIT_00_A_00
Could you describe your conclusions after examining the children?
$GEN_010_WIT_00_A_01
They were weakened and gaunt, clearly malnourished. They must have been in that state for some time.
$GEN_010_WIT_00_A_02
Would a few loaves of bread from the baker have helped to avert the tragedy?
$GEN_010_WIT_00_A_03
You cannot give a starving person bread on an empty stomach. That usually has a disastrous effect. And, no, a little bread would simply postpone their death for a few days.
$GEN_010_WIT_00_A_04
How dare you!
$GEN_010_WIT_00_A_05
Perhaps in those few days the parents would have been able to find more food.
$GEN_010_WIT_00_A_06
Perhaps.
$GEN_010_WIT_01_A_QTitle
What do you think about the Austrian plan to starve all of Paris?
$GEN_010_WIT_01_A_00
What do you think about the Austrian plan to starve all of Paris?
$GEN_010_WIT_01_A_01
That is just ridiculous. One baker?
$GEN_010_WIT_01_A_02
People talk of dozens.
$GEN_010_WIT_01_A_03
In my experience, people often talk nonsense. A large group of uneducated people will always look for a simple answer.
$GEN_010_WIT_01_A_04
But let us assume, for a moment, that those rumours are indeed true. Would such a conspiracy of bakers lead to the deaths of a large number of people?
$GEN_010_WIT_01_A_05
I guess it would, yes. Many Parisians eat mostly bread, so the number of deaths would increase.
$GEN_010_WIT_01_A_06
Have you recently noticed an increase in the number of people starving to death?
$GEN_010_WIT_01_A_07
Yes, but I really don’t think that it’s the result of a plot. There are other reasons too – food supply troubles and the war, and the chaos caused by them both too.
$GEN_010_WIT_01_A_08
Good thing we figured it out! Treason!
$GEN_010_WIT_02_A_QTitle
How long have you been trading?
$GEN_010_WIT_02_A_00
How long have you been trading?
$GEN_010_WIT_02_A_01
Six or seven years now.
$GEN_010_WIT_02_A_02
Did you notice a change in the defendant’s behaviour recently?
$GEN_010_WIT_02_A_03
No, he was kind, like always. Though he tried to convince me to trade only with him.
$GEN_010_WIT_02_A_04
What did you say? Was that not a suspicious request?
$GEN_010_WIT_02_A_05
I agreed. Why would I care? He always paid well and was buying enough. I mean, sure, it was odd that he had that much money with him, but that’s none of my business, right?
$GEN_010_WIT_02_A_06
Did any of your other clients regularly buy such quantities of flour?
$GEN_010_WIT_02_A_07
It was unusual, yes. I don’t know why he needed so much flour. But these are difficult times and he always paid in advance. Other people often asked for a deferred payment, but he never has.
$GEN_010_WIT_02_A_08
Renoir never asked for a deferred payment?
$GEN_010_WIT_02_A_09
No.
$GEN_010_WIT_02_A_10
The Austrians must have paid the baker well for his information so he could buy all that flour.
$GEN_010_WIT_03_A_QTitle
Ruttmann is a strange name for a Frenchman.
$GEN_010_WIT_03_A_00
Ruttmann is a strange name for a Frenchman.
$GEN_010_WIT_03_A_01
My father came from Hanover.
$GEN_010_WIT_03_A_02
Is the Citizen aware that we are also at war with Hanover?
$GEN_010_WIT_03_A_03
So what? My father is dead and he can’t fight with anyone. I was born here.

He claims that nobody asked him for anything.
