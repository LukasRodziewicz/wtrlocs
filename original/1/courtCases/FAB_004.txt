The defendant is Olivier Mugler, a 65-year-old <a name="1" class="hidden">master locksmith</a> who is famed among Parisian burglars as an expert on unopenable locks.
$FAB_004_DOC_1_01
Last month, he was commissioned by the owners of a Parisian glassworks – Jean Rude, Louis Roux, and Ferdinand Salan – to <a name="2" class="hidden">construct locks</a> for ornate chests for valuables, presumably as gifts for their wives. The craftsman praised his latest creation as “thief-proof”. Shortly following their completion, the industrialists’ houses were hit by <a name="3" class="hidden">a series of burglaries</a> committed by a recent newcomer to Paris, Hector Vian. The <a name="4" class="hidden">thief from Orleans</a> was caught in the act and shot by Ferdinand Salan.
$FAB_004_DOC_1_02
An expensive Turgot map of Paris with the <a name="5" class="hidden">houses</a> of the recently robbed industrialists marked on it was found on the deceased. Surprisingly, Salan had given Mugler an identical map as advance payment. This deposit was in addition to the agreed remuneration from all the employers.
$FAB_004_DOC_1_03
Further interesting information came from the owner of the Ginger Margot Inn. She recalled that on the night preceding the burglary, the locksmith met there with a man she didn’t recognise. Based on her description we were able to identify him as the aforementioned Hector Vian. The men allegedly engaged in an <a name="7" class="hidden">evening of drinking</a> sponsored by Mugler.

Robbing the bourgeoisie is no crime!
$FAB_004_OnStart_01
According to the case file, you are Citizen Olivier Mugler. Is that correct?
$FAB_004_OnStart_02
Indeed it is, monsieur le juge. May I have a request? I would like to sit down. I’m an old man you see…
$FAB_004_OnStart_03
Basic respect for the judiciary requires that you remain standing. Do the names Salan, Rude, and Roux mean anything to you?
$FAB_004_OnStart_04
Why are you so determined to harass an old man?
$FAB_004_OnStart_05
They sound like the names of my debtors.
$FAB_004_OnStart_06
Debtors? They are the victims of activities you conducted.
$FAB_004_OnStart_07
You mean locksmithing?
$FAB_004_OnPrison_00
I sentence Citizen Mugler to prison! Take the convict away.
$FAB_004_OnPrison_01
Outrageous!
$FAB_004_OnPrison_02
How can you do that to an innocent man?
$FAB_004_OnPrison_03
We have the clues, strong evidence… and a convenient verdict – for the Judge, at least. But are you completely certain of his guilt?
$FAB_004_OnNotGuilty_00
The verdict for Citizen Olivier Mugler is… not guilty! Lead the defendant away.
$FAB_004_OnNotGuilty_01
Bravo, Mugler!
$FAB_004_OnNotGuilty_02
Away with the bourgeoisie!
$FAB_004_OnNotGuilty_03
To be honest, this does bear the marks of social justice – they would not pay him, so he had them robbed. There is balance here.
$FAB_004_02x05_00_QTitle
You were commissioned by the victims to make chest locks…
$FAB_004_02x05_00_00
You were commissioned by the victims to make chest locks. Who installed them?
$FAB_004_02x05_00_01
It was me, naturally, and all in agreement with the contract. My job was to prepare and install the locks, and the employer was only to come and see whether the work was completed. And pay, of course.
$FAB_004_02x05_00_02
Was the installation carried out at your workshop?
$FAB_004_02x05_00_03
No, on site, at the client's property. None of those idlers bothered to deliver the trunks to my workshop, so I had to strain my old legs.
$FAB_004_02x05_00_04
Does that mean you knew the addresses of the victims?
$FAB_004_02x05_00_05
How else would I get there? Blindfolded and on a wagon?
$FAB_004_04x07_01_QTitle
Did you know Hector Vian before?
$FAB_004_04x07_01_00
Did you know Hector Vian before?
$FAB_004_04x07_01_01
This is the first time I’ve heard the name.
$FAB_004_04x07_01_02
That is interesting, as you were seen draining several bottles of wine together at the Ginger Margot Inn.
$FAB_004_04x07_01_03
Is that a crime?
$FAB_004_04x07_01_04
No, but the question is, why are you denying it now? Was your drinking spree just a deception for discussing the burglary?
$FAB_004_04x07_01_05
Nobody I had a drink with introduced themselves as Hector. I didn’t plan any heist with a Hector, Victor, or Hugo. I’m a locksmith and I earn good money from it. Burglaries are for vagrants without a job.
$FAB_004_06x08_02_QTitle
Do you recognise this map?
$FAB_004_06x08_02_00
Do you recognise this map?
$FAB_004_06x08_02_01
No. I don’t recall ever seeing it before.
$FAB_004_06x08_02_02
Ferdinand Salan claims that he gave you this map as advance payment for your services.
$FAB_004_06x08_02_03
He claims what?! That wicked wretch of a second-rate merchant! He gave me a scrap of paper as payment for making three locks, and says it’s supposed to be worth more than the 3,000 francs he owes me?!
$FAB_004_06x08_02_04
An honest labourer is being judged, while frauds remain at large!
$FAB_004_06x08_02_05
Silence! So this map does belong to you?
$FAB_004_06x08_02_06
It doesn’t.
$FAB_004_06x08_02_07
So where is the map that you received from Citizen Salan?
$FAB_004_06x08_02_08
I lost it, but it wasn’t even worth a loaf of bread, so I surely won’t shed a tear. But if you have it, maybe you stole it from me! You’d better make a note that Olivier Mugler demands remuneration from Rude, Roux, and Salan!
$FAB_004_05x08_03_QTitle
Were you the one who marked the addresses of the three victims on the map?
$FAB_004_05x08_03_00
Were you the one who marked the addresses of the three victims on the map?
$FAB_004_05x08_03_01
I didn’t mark anything.
$FAB_004_05x08_03_02
The houses of your clients are marked on the map.
$FAB_004_05x08_03_03
I don’t know who marked them. Maybe you should ask the person you found the map on.
$FAB_004_05x08_03_04
Maybe the court made the marks and has no memory of doing so?
$FAB_004_05x08_03_05
Do you not think there are too many coincidences in your story? You obtain the map, but lose it, and then it is found on the thief who has robbed your clients?
$FAB_004_05x08_03_06
I know nothing of coincidences. I only make locks.
$FAB_004_01x02_04_QTitle
How much did you charge for your services?
$FAB_004_01x02_04_00
How much did you charge for your services?
$FAB_004_01x02_04_01
3,000 francs.
$FAB_004_01x02_04_02
Tidy sum, that is…
$FAB_004_01x02_04_03
If you were a master locksmith you’d charge that much too.
$FAB_004_01x02_04_04
That is quite a substantial fee…
$FAB_004_01x02_04_05
Indeed. That’s how much it costs to have high-quality locks made by a master with nearly 50 years of experience. And those bastards never paid me a single franc!
$FAB_004_01x02_04_06
The victims did not pay you the agreed amount?
$FAB_004_01x02_04_07
Not a franc. I’d beat that money right out of them, but I’m too old for that.
$FAB_004_04x06_05_QTitle
Did you give Hector Vian the map…?
$FAB_004_04x06_05_00
Did you give Hector Vian the map with the victims’ houses marked on it?
$FAB_004_04x06_05_01
I gave nothing to Achilles, Hector, or any other Greek.
$FAB_004_04x06_05_02
Call in the witness, Citizen Jean Rude.
$FAB_004_04x06_05_04
Jean Rude, in the flesh.
$FAB_004_04x06_05_05
You will not speak unless called upon.
$FAB_004_04x06_05_06
Naturally, of course.
$FAB_004_01x03_06_QTitle
Rumour has it that you are one of the best locksmiths in Paris.
$FAB_004_01x03_06_00
Rumour has it that you are one of the best locksmiths in Paris.
$FAB_004_01x03_06_01
I should deny it for modesty’s sake, but I will not.
$FAB_004_01x03_06_02
That cannot be true, though, as a random thief from Orleans was easily able to open your locks.
$FAB_004_01x03_06_03
Well, then he must've been one of the best thieves in Orleans. Let's be serious, monsieur le juge, every lock can be picked with the right talents, even my locks.
$FAB_004_02x04_07_QTitle
Did you tell Hector Vian how to open…?
$FAB_004_02x04_07_00
Did you tell Hector Vian how to open the locks in the victims’ trunks?
$FAB_004_02x04_07_01
I understand what you’re implying, but consider this – if he sold the secret of my locks, then my business would be over. Word spreads fast among thieves.
$FAB_004_WIT_00_A_QTitle
What went missing during the burglary?
$FAB_004_WIT_00_A_00
What went missing during the burglary?
$FAB_004_WIT_00_A_01
My house was the first one to be robbed, and in my case it was mostly valuables. At Roux’s house – he will not say it himself and I do not want to go to prison – it was the letters he had exchanged over the years with King Louis…
$FAB_004_WIT_00_A_02
Damn Monarchist!
$FAB_004_WIT_00_A_03
Salan did not lose a thing, he shot that vermin in the act. That is what he said.
$FAB_004_WIT_00_A_04
What happened to the items he had stolen?
$FAB_004_WIT_00_A_05
That still remains unknown. According to Salan, Hector had nothing with him. Ferdinand suspects he had hidden the other valuables somewhere.
$FAB_004_WIT_00_A_06
He hid the other items before robbing the last house? Strange.
$FAB_004_WIT_01_A_QTitle
You look upset. What are you afraid of?
$FAB_004_WIT_01_A_00
You look upset. What are you afraid of?
$FAB_004_WIT_01_A_01
Monsieur le juge, that crowd behind me, and, you know…
$FAB_004_WIT_01_A_02
Know what?
$FAB_004_WIT_01_A_03
I do not want to go to prison, and Salan said that if I were to talk nonsense in court, I would be sentenced to a few years. Is that true?
$FAB_004_WIT_01_A_04
Citizen Ferdinand Salan instructed you on what to testify?
$FAB_004_WIT_01_A_05
No. Well, he might have offered some suggestions on how not to get into trouble by speaking gibberish. I am a rather nervous person, and I sometimes struggle to make sense.
$FAB_004_WIT_01_A_07
A fool more than a witness. That’s our bourgeoisie.
$FAB_004_WIT_01_B_QTitle
Advance payment in the form of a map, its disappearance, the murder of a burglar, and a lack of payment for services.
$FAB_004_WIT_01_B_00
Advance payment in the form of a map, its disappearance, the murder of a burglar, and a lack of payment for services. It all makes for a rather strange story. A suspicious one too.
$FAB_004_WIT_01_B_01
I do not…
$FAB_004_WIT_01_B_02
What are you mumbling?
$FAB_004_WIT_01_B_03
If I say… something… will I be free?
$FAB_004_WIT_01_B_04
He knows something!
$FAB_004_WIT_01_B_05
Please testify what you know immediately!
$FAB_004_WIT_01_B_06
That map was Salan’s idea. He told the thief about the advance payment we gave to the locksmith and proposed that Hector steal it.
$FAB_004_WIT_01_B_07
And he did?
$FAB_004_WIT_01_B_08
Indeed, but then the bastard robbed us! Later, we were forced by Salan not to pay the locksmith because he sent the thief after us. And that’s when it all went down the drain.
$FAB_004_WIT_01_B_09
That’s the bourgeoisie for you! He fooled them all in one fell swoop.
$FAB_004_WIT_01_B_10
It sounds like Citizen Salan had everything planned. However, there is no evidence to support the claim. Perhaps it is Citizen Rude that is plotting against his partner and wants to frame him?
$FAB_004_WIT_01_B_11
And Vian is dead, so he will not be able shed light on any of this.
$FAB_004_WIT_01_B_13
If I was younger, I’d give that Salan a drubbing. That pig, that good-for-nothing, lying bastard!
$FAB_004_WIT_01_B_14
Please, restrain yourself. The testimony of a witness is still not evidence – neither of Citizen Salan’s guilt, nor of your innocence.

Look, an authentic map by Turgot. It would be a pity if it rotted in a safe-deposit box…
$FAB_004_postCourt_01
We cannot do that.
$FAB_004_postCourt_02
These are court deposits.
$FAB_004_postCourt_03
Well, Mathilde did tell me long ago to take care of my study at home…
$FAB_004_postCourt_04
There you go. I know someone who can remove these marks without damaging the map.
