Jean-François Vary, a 38-year-old former chef who worked for Marquis de Rougé, is awaiting trial in a prison cell. His former employer was a Monarchist and plotter who was sentenced to be guillotined and stripped of his fortune. We established that Vary was not only a cook, but also <a name="2" class="hidden">a friend of the marquis</a>. We do not know what he was doing after his employer was arrested, however a year later he opened <a name="3" class="hidden">a luxurious restaurant</a> in Paris called Under the Gold Chimera. It is especially popular among the aristocracy and rich merchants and manufacturers.
$GEN_027_DOC_01_01
Vary was brought to the National Guard by a furious crowd after he <a name="4" class="hidden">hung a sign</a> over the restaurant that read “The best Citizens are welcome”. The Parisians who conducted the unauthorised arrest accused the restaurateur of having Counter-Revolutionary views and fighting the people of Paris. Soldiers arrived quickly at the scene. Although they did not manage to save the sign, they stopped the crowd from setting the restaurant, and its guests, on fire.
$GEN_027_DOC_01_02
The investigation revealed that Vary was clearly giving clients from lower social spheres <a name="6" class="hidden">worse treatment</a> than aristocrats. He would even overcharge them or refuse to serve them at all.
$GEN_027_DOC_01_03
One of the most telling incidents involved the indignation felt by the rich and respected cobbler <a name="7" class="hidden">Paul Idrac</a> when he was publicly forced to leave the restaurant. Allegedly, Vary personally escorted Idrac outside and called him a “pleb not deserving to eat with his superiors”.

That cooking piece of shit thinks he’s better than us!
$GEN_027_OnStart_01
Please introduce yourself.
$GEN_027_OnStart_02
My name is Jean-François Vary, monsieur le juge.
$GEN_027_OnStart_03
Jean-François, you are accused of having and acting upon views that are contradictory to the accomplishments of the Revolution. How do you plead to those charges?
$GEN_027_OnStart_04
Those accusations are ridiculous. It’s just slander and… and… the illegal activity of people who are jealous of my business!
$GEN_027_OnStart_05
The files clearly indicate that it was you who broke the law.
$GEN_027_OnStart_06
Tell me, when and how did I break the law?
$GEN_027_OnStart_07
You were denying service to Citizens that you consider to be inferior. Moreover, you openly admitted to it in front of those discriminated clients and everyone else.
$GEN_027_OnStart_08
That’s just a misunderstanding between my clients and I, definitely not a matter for the court.
$GEN_027_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Jean-François to be guillotined! Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_027_OnGuilty_01
Show him his place!
$GEN_027_OnGuilty_02
Bravo!
$GEN_027_OnGuilty_03
Today we took the side of ordinary Parisians.
$GEN_027_OnNotGuilty_00
The verdict in the case of Jean-François is… not guilty! The defendant is free to go.
$GEN_027_OnNotGuilty_01
Is he insane?!
$GEN_027_OnNotGuilty_02
You’re freeing an enemy of the people!
$GEN_027_OnNotGuilty_03
Do you hope for a good table and free dinner?
$GEN_027_02x04_00_QTitle
Which Citizens do you refer to as “the best”?
$GEN_027_02x04_00_00
Which Citizens do you refer to as “the best”?
$GEN_027_02x04_00_01
Those who are well versed in etiquette and pay for their meals – the full price.
$GEN_027_02x04_00_02
And who fulfils those requirements?
$GEN_027_02x04_00_03
I know from experience that it’s mostly aristocrats and industrialists. High society, as they are sometimes called.
$GEN_027_02x04_00_04
So, from your perspective, aristocrats are superior Citizens?
$GEN_027_02x04_00_05
I never intended to divide people into superior and inferior.
$GEN_027_02x04_00_06
Yet you did. Your sign denied access to those you considered inferior.
$GEN_027_02x04_00_07
Did you see it with your own eyes?
$GEN_027_02x04_00_08
No, the crowd destroyed it.
$GEN_027_02x04_00_09
I only wrote that Under the Gold Chimera is where the best Citizens eat. What’s Counter-Revolutionary about that?
$GEN_027_02x04_00_10
Liar! We know what we saw.
$GEN_027_02x04_00_11
You can’t even read, you drudges!
$GEN_027_02x05_01_QTitle
How do you remember the times before the Revolution?
$GEN_027_02x05_01_00
How do you remember the times before the Revolution?
$GEN_027_02x05_01_01
As a master of my trade, I lived a decent life.
$GEN_027_02x05_01_02
That was all you cared about?
$GEN_027_02x05_01_03
Well, it’s not that I–
$GEN_027_02x05_01_04
Because you and the marquis got fat off our misery!
$GEN_027_02x05_01_05
So you do not support the Revolution?
$GEN_027_02x05_01_06
That’s not true! I only mean to say that I never experienced the incredible injustice suffered by others.
$GEN_027_02x05_01_07
Of course not, you were living in a palace, not a barn.
$GEN_027_02x05_01_08
Monsieur le juge, I worked hard for my privileges. I was not born to a rich family, and I had to work for bread like everyone else.
$GEN_027_04x05_02_QTitle
Did you hang the sign over your restaurant?
$GEN_027_04x05_02_00
Did you hang the sign over your restaurant?
$GEN_027_04x05_02_01
Yes, monsieur le juge, I did.
$GEN_027_04x05_02_02
Why did you do it? The message on the sign clearly contradicted the Revolutionary ideals of equality and fraternity.
$GEN_027_04x05_02_03
I just wanted to let everyone know that my restaurant fulfils the requirements of even the most fastidious of clientele.
$GEN_027_04x05_02_04
What about ordinary people and their requirements?
$GEN_027_04x05_02_05
I would eat there, why not.
$GEN_027_04x05_02_06
It’s not what you think. There are a variety of restaurants, both cheap and expensive. I just wanted to let my clients know what they can expect inside.
$GEN_027_04x05_02_07
The sign indicates that a wide range of clients are not welcome.
$GEN_027_04x05_02_08
Everyone is welcome, as long as they know how to behave and pay for what they eat. I can at least be allowed to expect the money they owe and good manners from them, can’t I?
$GEN_027_04x05_02_09
What a snotty, greedy son of a bitch!
$GEN_027_04x05_02_10
Do you hear the contempt in his voice?
$GEN_027_06x07_03_QTitle
Call in the witness, Paul Idrac.
$GEN_027_06x07_03_00
Call in the witness, Paul Idrac.
$GEN_027_06x07_03_02
Please introduce yourself.
$GEN_027_06x07_03_03
I’m Paul Idrac.
$GEN_027_06x07_03_04
What is your occupation?
$GEN_027_06x07_03_05
I’m a cobbler, monsieur le juge, like my father and grandfather.
$GEN_027_05x06_04_QTitle
Is it normal for a restaurateur to refuse clients?
$GEN_027_05x06_04_00
Is it normal for a restaurateur to refuse clients?
$GEN_027_05x06_04_01
When a man whose pockets are filled with nothing but holes comes to a store and asks for a gold snuffbox, do you think someone would serve him?
$GEN_027_05x06_04_02
So you asked people to show the contents of their pockets at the entrance?
$GEN_027_05x06_04_03
No.
$GEN_027_05x06_04_04
Then how did you know whom to serve?
$GEN_027_05x06_04_05
It’s obvious at first sight.
$GEN_027_05x06_04_06
He didn’t like our rough faces!
$GEN_027_03x04_05_QTitle
Are you prejudiced against people who do not come from the aristocracy?
$GEN_027_03x04_05_00
Are you prejudiced against people who do not come from the aristocracy?
$GEN_027_03x04_05_01
Why would I be? I did not come from them myself.
$GEN_027_03x04_05_02
Your behaviour would indicate otherwise.
$GEN_027_03x04_05_03
People who can afford to eat at my restaurant like to be complimented.
$GEN_027_03x04_05_04
And the others like to be insulted?
$GEN_027_03x04_05_05
I didn’t insult anyone!
$GEN_027_03x04_05_06
Did you hear that? He didn’t insult anyone.
$GEN_027_WIT_00_A_QTitle
Did you give the accused any reason to throw you out of the restaurant?
$GEN_027_WIT_00_A_00
Did you give the accused any reason to throw you out of the restaurant?
$GEN_027_WIT_00_A_01
Not at all! Vary told me to leave because the high and mighty didn’t like the company of a cobbler!
$GEN_027_WIT_00_A_02
Did you behave inappropriately? Were you too loud, perhaps?
$GEN_027_WIT_00_A_03
No, the only concern was my background.
$GEN_027_WIT_00_A_04
How do you know that was the reason?
$GEN_027_WIT_00_A_05
Vary told me so himself, before even opening the door! I showed him the money to prove that I could pay, but he wouldn’t listen. Obviously, Baron Laval and his mistress didn’t like the idea of sharing the room with a cobbler.
$GEN_027_WIT_01_A_QTitle
Do you know of other people who were forced to leave the restaurant?
$GEN_027_WIT_01_A_00
Do you know of other people who were forced to leave the restaurant?
$GEN_027_WIT_01_A_01
Of course, I know at least a few people who were thrown out because they stood out from the other clientele – you know, they weren’t aristocrats.
$GEN_027_WIT_01_A_03
Monsieur le juge, he’s lying. I told him to leave because I caught him trying to steal the silverware.
$GEN_027_WIT_01_A_04
Did you notify the proper authorities?
$GEN_027_WIT_01_A_05
Well… no. I decided there was no offence as he didn’t manage to steal anything.
$GEN_027_WIT_01_B_QTitle
What do you know about the political views of the accused?
$GEN_027_WIT_01_B_00
What do you know about the political views of the accused?
$GEN_027_WIT_01_B_01
Monsieur le juge, I have been a Revolutionary from the very beginning and I can smell a Monarchist a mile away. This one is a full-blown enemy of the Revolution.
$GEN_027_WIT_01_B_02
How can you be so sure?
$GEN_027_WIT_01_B_03
It was enough just to hear what he said when throwing me out.
$GEN_027_WIT_01_B_04
Go on.
$GEN_027_WIT_01_B_05
When I landed in the mud, he said that in the past the plebs knew their place, but the Revolution had turned everything upside down, and damn the Revolution.
$GEN_027_WIT_01_B_06
Can you prove it?
$GEN_027_WIT_01_B_07
Am I not the proof?
$GEN_027_WIT_01_B_09
Monsieur le juge, I don’t recall using such words. This man tries to cast aspersions on me!
