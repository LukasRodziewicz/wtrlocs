 The defendant is Jeanne Marie Roland, wife of a minister who sympathised with the guillotined Louis Capet. The woman has been accused of instigating treason and corrupting deputies of the Convention. She supposedly bribed them with the services of prostitutes who worked for her under the cover of a political salon.
$FAB_008_DOC_1_01
Initially, we knew little about the defendant’s activity. As a woman, she <a name="2" class="hidden">did not take part</a> in the life of politics reserved for men, instead supposedly <a name="3" class="hidden">hosting a political salon</a>, where the personages of Paris could meet and discuss the current social and political situation. It is true that such meetings indeed took place, but, as we have learned from our informants, the circumstances were morally controversial. The disputants were entertained by ladies of questionable virtue. Luxurious or not, Madame Roland in essence ran a <a name="4" class="hidden">brothel</a>.
$FAB_008_DOC_1_02
As we gathered information, gossip regarding the defendant’s involvement in her husband’s career became increasingly credible. We know that the resourceful woman was able to act behind the scenes to win the support of the minister’s political opponents, and those who resisted her persuasive talk were tempted by the naked bodies of her girls. Hosting the salon, she was also able to become familiar with the <a name="6" class="hidden">varied views</a> of the prominent Convention deputies. As a result, she was able to steer her husband’s career, even without his knowledge.
$FAB_008_DOC_1_03
The above findings have been confirmed by Isabelle Dugard, who worked for the defendant under the alias <a name="7" class="hidden">“Giselle”</a>. She testified that Madame Roland had many times hosted <a name="8" class="hidden">three men</a>, and while she did not know their names, she unhesitatingly referred to them as “scum of the deepest dye”. I think that we can certainly make a link between these people and the three assassins who <a name="9" class="hidden">attacked Judge Fidèle</a>. It is awful to think how many deaths they could have been involved in.
$FAB_008_DOC_1_04
Based on our information, we can deduce that the gossip about Madame Roland being one of the pillars of the <a name="10" class="hidden">coup d’état</a> planned by the Girondins is true. She did have an influence on her husband’s career, and it is highly probable that he was able to achieve such a prominent position due to her involvement. She cooperated with individuals of questionable reputation, and she must have mastered the art of lying if she was able to <a name="11" class="hidden">keep everything secret</a> for such a long time.
$FAB_008_OnStart_00
The defendant may introduce herself.
$FAB_008_OnStart_01
Jeanne Marie Roland.
$FAB_008_OnStart_02
The wife of the corrupt and treacherous Minister Roland!
$FAB_008_OnStart_03
I have only been asked to give my name. You need not make a show of it, Prosecutor.
$FAB_008_OnStart_04
You have been accused of instigating treason and corruption…
$FAB_008_OnStart_05
And I, of course, deny these nonsensical accusations.
$FAB_008_OnStart_06
Of course!
$FAB_008_OnStart_07
Since when do we even talk to traitors?
$FAB_008_OnGuilty_00
Your guilt is unquestionable. I sentence you to death.
$FAB_008_OnGuilty_01
I have nothing to add!
$FAB_008_OnGuilty_02
We want blood!
$FAB_008_OnGuilty_03
Off with her head!
$FAB_008_OnGuilty_04
That’s what happens to traitors!
$FAB_008_OnPrison_00
There is no justification for what you have done. You will spend the rest of your life in a cell.
$FAB_008_OnPrison_01
Due to the gravity of these accusations, I propose that you rethink your decision.
$FAB_008_OnPrison_02
That’s not good enough, we want her blood!
$FAB_008_OnNotGuilty_00
After considering all the evidence, I find you innocent, Citizen.
$FAB_008_OnNotGuilty_01
Really? And what about the corruption? The whores? The coup?
$FAB_008_OnNotGuilty_02
Treason!
$FAB_008_OnNotGuilty_03
Traitors, the lot of them!
$FAB_008_OnNotGuilty_04
The new government is worse than that turd of a king!
$FAB_008_01x02_00_QTitle
Did you feel excluded by the Revolution?
$FAB_008_01x02_00_00
Did you feel excluded by the Revolution?
$FAB_008_01x02_00_01
I do not believe I understand the question.
$FAB_008_01x02_00_02
Let me explain, monsieur le juge. As a woman, did you resent the Revolution due to the limited possibilities for your sex to play a role in politics?
$FAB_008_01x02_00_03
What a ridiculous assumption. I agree with the views of Citizen Danton when he clearly summarised the role of women in France today – they should give birth to children, and raise them to become the future guardians of the Republic.
$FAB_008_01x02_00_04
A nice speech.
$FAB_008_01x02_00_05
And you are raising a guardian like this, Citizen?
$FAB_008_01x02_00_06
A female guardian, yes.
$FAB_008_01x02_00_07
Who will also not have much to say in the future, either.
$FAB_008_01x02_00_08
Let us hope she will find herself a proper husband, as I did.
$FAB_008_01x06_01_QTitle
As a result of your activity, you had access to the views of prominent politicians.
$FAB_008_01x06_01_00
As a result of your activity, you had access to the views of prominent politicians.
$FAB_008_01x06_01_01
That is quite natural if you host meetings at which such politicians attend to share their opinions.
$FAB_008_01x06_01_02
How much of this knowledge did you obtain by running a brothel?
$FAB_008_01x06_01_03
Very little. Most people prefer to stay silent during… those situations. And surely they do not talk about politics.
$FAB_008_01x06_01_04
Nevertheless, thanks to your obscene parlour, you were able to obtain information that would be invaluable to a foreign power.
$FAB_008_01x06_01_05
I do not know, it could be. But I would have never sold it.
$FAB_008_01x06_01_06
Unselfish honesty?
$FAB_008_01x06_01_07
If I had sold such information to anyone, Madame de Staël would have immediately invited the aggrieved party to come to her salon instead.
$FAB_008_01x06_01_08
A selfish hag.
$FAB_008_01x06_01_09
Everybody loves France in their own way. I do not betray my friends, and that is why they stand firm beside me.
$FAB_008_01x06_01_10
And you will soon end up together, kneeling beneath the guillotine.
$FAB_008_01x10_02_QTitle
Did you participate in planning the coup d’état?
$FAB_008_01x10_02_00
Did you participate in planning of the coup d’état?
$FAB_008_01x10_02_01
Monsieur le juge, we both know very well there were no plans for a coup d’état. This has been entirely made up by Robespierre and the Court. You have looked at my husband and seen an enemy.
$FAB_008_01x10_02_02
Our informants–
$FAB_008_01x10_02_03
Are who? Of course, you cannot give me their names because it is nothing more than gossip and pure fiction. A political game.
$FAB_008_01x10_02_04
That’s right, where’s the evidence then?
$FAB_008_01x10_02_05
We don’t need no evidence for traitors to the nation!
$FAB_008_01x10_02_06
Please answer the original question.
$FAB_008_01x10_02_07
I did not participate in any stage of the alleged coup d’état. Neither I, nor my husband, had anything to do with it. You have no evidence, and you do nothing but guess.
$FAB_008_02x03_03_QTitle
What was your motivation to establish a political salon?
$FAB_008_02x03_03_00
What was your motivation to establish a political salon?
$FAB_008_02x03_03_01
With my husband’s position, he meets many interesting people, and I did not want to miss the opportunity of having the pleasure to talk with the greatest minds of our times.
$FAB_008_02x03_03_02
Would you agree with the statement that during such conversations, politicians could have changed their views in a manner that better suited you and your husband?
$FAB_008_02x03_03_03
Who does not change their views in politics? Is that not what democracy is all about? To allow for the free exchange of ideas?
$FAB_008_02x03_03_04
That is true, but it is not about manipulating the people who are responsible for our country!
$FAB_008_02x03_03_05
Then what else is politics about? And what is the true purpose of this trial?
$FAB_008_04x03_04_QTitle
Did you corrupt the Convention deputies and–
$FAB_008_04x03_04_00
Did you corrupt the Convention deputies and–
$FAB_008_04x03_04_01
Excuse me for interrupting you, monsieur le juge, but the very thought of influencing politicians in such a despicable manner makes me sick! For innocent girls to be used by Monarchists…
$FAB_008_04x03_04_02
I would like to remark that the politicians took advantage of the services these girls provided of their own free will. They came to me to talk about politics. Who they left with, and what for, if you excuse me, is none of my business.
$FAB_008_04x03_04_03
Did you receive anything in exchange for arranging such meetings?
$FAB_008_04x03_04_04
If anything at all, only their willingness to return and discuss politics.
$FAB_008_04x03_04_05
In other words, it could be said they were regulars to your brothel.
$FAB_008_04x03_04_06
It is not a brothel! It is something more complicated. Rather, a place for the exchange of modern thought.
$FAB_008_04x03_04_07
A modern brothel!
$FAB_008_04x03_04_08
But you will not deny the fact that, in your salon, the politicians enjoyed… sensual pleasures?
$FAB_008_04x03_04_09
This is a free country, and I am a tolerant person.
$FAB_008_04x11_05_QTitle
You have truly perfected the art of masking yourself.
$FAB_008_04x11_05_00
You have truly perfected the art of masking yourself. A political salon that turns out to be nothing more than an ordinary brothel.
$FAB_008_04x11_05_01
What is your question?
$FAB_008_04x11_05_02
How did you manage to keep this a secret from the people for so long?
$FAB_008_04x11_05_03
I hosted a political salon. Sometimes we were joined by beautiful girls who came over to earn a piece of bread. They stayed close to the deputies, but they were never importunate.
$FAB_008_04x11_05_04
And you did not mind that?
$FAB_008_04x11_05_05
I understood them. Women have to stick together. And I will not let you call my political salon a brothel! It was more than just an ordinary place. The brightest minds met there to–
$FAB_008_04x11_05_06
Spare us the advertisement. The place will be razed to the ground after you have been guillotined.
$FAB_008_05x07_06_QTitle
Call in Isabelle Dugard.
$FAB_008_05x07_06_00
Call in Isabelle Dugard.
$FAB_008_05x07_06_02
Please introduce yourself.
$FAB_008_05x07_06_03
My name’s Giselle.
$FAB_008_05x07_06_04
Your real name, please.
$FAB_008_05x07_06_05
But that’s my real… Oh, all right, me love. My name’s Isabelle Dugard.
$FAB_008_05x07_06_06
You should address me as “monsieur le juge”.
$FAB_008_05x07_06_07
“All right, me love.” She’s good, ha!
$FAB_008_08x09_07_QTitle
Do you know about the attempt on my life?
$FAB_008_08x09_07_00
Do you know about the attempt on my life?
$FAB_008_08x09_07_01
I did hear about that. What a horrible affair…
$FAB_008_08x09_07_02
I was attacked by three cut-throats, and one of your charges has testified that she regularly saw three men of doubtful reputation at your establishment.
$FAB_008_08x09_07_03
I doubt this is little more than a coincidence and a misunderstanding…
$FAB_008_08x09_07_04
And in light of the fact that your husband swore to see to my death?
$FAB_008_08x09_07_05
People say different things when they are upset or agitated. It does not mean they will act upon their words.
$FAB_008_08x09_07_06
The whole of Paris knows the minister does nothing without his wife’s instructions.
$FAB_008_08x09_07_07
You will pay for raising your hand against the Judge of the Tribunal.
$FAB_008_08x09_07_08
You heard that? An execution’s on the way!
$FAB_008_08x10_08_QTitle
Did the three men, referred to by the witness as “scum of the deepest dye”…
$FAB_008_08x10_08_00
Did the three men, referred to by the witness as “scum of the deepest dye”, participate in the planned assassination?
$FAB_008_08x10_08_01
There was no assassination, and those three are… fruit sellers.
$FAB_008_08x10_08_02
Fruit?
$FAB_008_08x10_08_03
Yes, there is nothing suspicious about it, and I do not judge people by their appearance.
$FAB_008_08x10_08_04
So they did not plan to stab Robespierre and his comrades to death?
$FAB_008_08x10_08_05
Absolutely not!
$FAB_008_08x10_08_06
Well, if they could not kill a judge of the Tribunal, how would they manage the deputies of the Convention?
$FAB_008_08x10_08_07
Ask them about the assassination attempt.
$FAB_008_08x10_08_08
Where did they get their fruit?
$FAB_008_08x10_08_09
I do not know. You should ask them.
$FAB_008_08x10_08_10
We have been unable to find these people.
$FAB_008_08x10_08_11
Well, clearly doing business in Paris is no longer profitable for them.
$FAB_008_WIT_00_A_QTitle
Tell me, do you know anything about the corruption of politicians in the defendant’s salon?
$FAB_008_WIT_00_A_00
Tell me, do you know anything about the corruption of politicians in the defendant’s salon?
$FAB_008_WIT_00_A_01
Well, me… monsieur le juge. We always does the same thing, but sometimes these guests come up with ideas, you know? This one deputy often says he wants me to act like a Spanish spy who’s trying to corrupt him.
$FAB_008_WIT_00_A_02
Disgusting.
$FAB_008_WIT_00_A_03
Me love, you look like you’d be wanting to play with a banana.
$FAB_008_WIT_00_A_04
Did Madame Roland corrupt–
$FAB_008_WIT_00_A_05
How’m I s’posed to know? Our guests don’t talk much. It’s kinda whatcha want for a proper good time, y’know?
$FAB_008_WIT_00_B_QTitle
Are you able to give an example of any incident, which, in your opinion, appeared to involve the corruption of a politician?
$FAB_008_WIT_00_B_00
Are you able to give an example of any incident, which, in your opinion, appeared to involve the corruption of a politician?
$FAB_008_WIT_00_B_01
If I told you about it, I’d be as well to leave the city.
$FAB_008_WIT_00_B_02
But if you do not tell me, your head will leave your body.
$FAB_008_WIT_00_B_03
Once I were told to go with a young man to this house, Deputy Pierre Vergniaud’s it was, and told to go in and take care of him as if me life depended on it.
$FAB_008_WIT_00_B_04
Is that all?
$FAB_008_WIT_00_B_05
That Vergniaud treated me with… all his might, if I can say that. Left me with plenty o’ bruises after. On me way out, he says to tell Madame Roland she can consider that matter they’d discussed dealt with.
$FAB_008_WIT_00_B_06
What a corrupted pig Vergniaud is!
