	In the evening, <a name="1" class="hidden">two hungry dogs</a> of an unknown breed attacked a meat merchant, Citizen Courbis, at the market. She tried to chase them away from her goods with a stick, but failed to scare them. The dogs knocked her to the ground and attacked her. When she finally managed to escape, they feasted on her <a name="3" class="hidden">leftover goods</a>.
$GEN_054_DOC_01_01
	The Guard arrived after a few minutes, but the animals were already gone. Locals immediately pointed to <a name="4" class="hidden">an old house</a> surrounded by a small park. We established that it is occupied by Gaëtan Thibodeaux, an elderly man who works as a night watchman at a nearby factory.
$GEN_054_DOC_01_02
	We arrested Thibodeaux, even though he refused to acknowledge the dogs, but unfortunately for him the offending animals returned home during the arrest. Soldiers <a name="5" class="hidden">tried to shoot the aggressive mutts</a>, but they disappeared in the dark.
$GEN_054_DOC_01_03
	Let it be noted that the attacked woman’s hands and face were severely bitten. We were a hair’s breadth from a tragedy.
$GEN_054_OnStart_00
Citizen Thibodeaux, do the dogs that attacked the stall-holder, Citizen Courbis, belong to you?
$GEN_054_OnStart_01
No, monsieur le juge, they are not mine.
$GEN_054_OnStart_02
Who do they belong to then, if I may ask?
$GEN_054_OnStart_03
My brother, Bruno Thibodeaux.
$GEN_054_OnStart_04
Where is he now?
$GEN_054_OnStart_05
I don’t know. He left some time ago and never came back. He probably fought somewhere and died.
$GEN_054_OnStart_06
Did he ask you to take care of his dogs?
$GEN_054_OnStart_07
We haven’t talked much in recent years. One day he just left, and that was it.
$GEN_054_OnGuilty_00
Citizen, I do not find your explanations convincing. For your extreme irresponsibility I sentence you to death.
$GEN_054_OnGuilty_01
I find this verdict severe, but just.
$GEN_054_OnGuilty_02
You shouldn’t kill him, just those damned dogs.
$GEN_054_OnNotGuilty_00
You cannot be held accountable for someone else’s dogs. I do not find you guilty.
$GEN_054_OnNotGuilty_01
I hope that once all this commotion ends, we will revisit this case.
$GEN_054_OnNotGuilty_02
Right… And that woman mauled her own self.
$GEN_054_04x03_00_QTitle
Do you live in a home surrounded by a garden?
$GEN_054_04x03_00_00
Do you live in a home surrounded by a garden?
$GEN_054_04x03_00_01
What does that have to do with the case?
$GEN_054_04x03_00_02
I was merely wondering how a watchman who cannot afford to buy food for two dogs is able to maintain such a house.
$GEN_054_04x03_00_03
It’s no palace. Our father bought it many years back for a good price. He wanted to show off in front of my mother, let her live like a Countess.
$GEN_054_04x03_00_04
Then what?
$GEN_054_04x03_00_05
Then we never had enough money to really maintain the place. We couldn’t repair the roof, replace the old windows…
$GEN_054_04x03_00_06
The fence is also in ruins, since the dogs can escape through the holes.
$GEN_054_04x03_00_07
That’s true, but do you know how much I would have to pay for that? What part of my salary?
$GEN_054_04x03_00_08
Why did you not sell the house?
$GEN_054_04x03_00_09
We couldn’t do it while our father was alive. It would have broken his heart.
$GEN_054_04x03_00_10
And after his death?
$GEN_054_04x03_00_11
Then the house was already in ruins, like it still is. Who would buy it now?
$GEN_054_01x04_01_QTitle
What are your dogs called?
$GEN_054_01x04_01_00
What are your dogs called?
$GEN_054_01x04_01_01
My brother’s, not mine. Guard and Officer.
$GEN_054_01x04_01_02
Who gives dogs names like that?
$GEN_054_01x04_01_03
They are incredibly sly.
$GEN_054_01x04_01_04
My brother found them wandering in the Parisian suburbs when they were still young. To this day, they’re a little feral.
$GEN_054_01x04_01_05
They’re wolves, not dogs.
$GEN_054_01x04_01_06
Were they aggressive?
$GEN_054_01x04_01_07
Not really, but people often complained the big beasts walked the streets like they owned them. No wonder. If I didn’t know them, I’d be scared as well.
$GEN_054_01x04_01_08
Did you do anything to stop them from scaring people?
$GEN_054_01x04_01_09
Well… my brother once chained them for a day, but they made such a noise…
$GEN_054_01x04_01_10
Oh no, them lords in their palace couldn’t stand the barking!
$GEN_054_03x06_02_QTitle
Why did you not feed the dogs?
$GEN_054_03x06_02_00
Why did you not feed the dogs?
$GEN_054_03x06_02_01
With what, monsieur le juge? I’m not earning a fortune, and more often than not I don’t even have enough for myself.
$GEN_054_03x06_02_02
What have they been eating since your brother’s disappearance?
$GEN_054_03x06_02_03
As if I know. They used to disappear for the whole day and come back when I was going to work, probably stuffed with something they found.
$GEN_054_03x06_02_04
And you never wondered if they hurt anyone?
$GEN_054_03x06_02_05
They aren’t mine.
$GEN_054_03x06_02_06
But you knew that they were wandering around hunting for food. You could have reported them.
$GEN_054_03x06_02_07
What if they’d attacked a child?
$GEN_054_03x06_02_08
I wasn’t the only one to see them. Why don’t you invite all the other people here who saw them and didn’t report it?
$GEN_054_05x01_03_QTitle
Where are your mongrels now?
$GEN_054_05x01_03_00
Where are your mongrels now?
$GEN_054_05x01_03_01
They’re not mine, and I don’t know where they are. When the soldiers started shooting, which they shouldn’t do in the city, the dogs scarpered.
$GEN_054_05x01_03_02
Then what?
$GEN_054_05x01_03_03
They brought me here in chains.
$GEN_054_05x01_03_04
While they’re having this idle conversation, those beasts are still running around Paris.
$GEN_054_05x01_03_05
Do you think they could find your brother?
$GEN_054_05x01_03_06
I think he was killed and robbed. Do you even know what’s going on in this city?
$GEN_054_05x01_03_07
You must have some idea where they were going. Show us some willingness to cooperate, it is for your own good.
$GEN_054_05x01_03_08
They liked to show up at the market and go to the fields on the outskirts of Paris. From time to time they walk around Les Halles.

What’s going on? Is this justice? Punishing someone because of another person’s dogs?
$GEN_054_UNIQUE_QUESTION_00
How did the defendant come into possession of such a large house?
$GEN_054_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_00_00
He inherited it from his father.
$GEN_054_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_00_00
He won it in a game of cards.
$GEN_054_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_00_01
He bought it in more fortunate times.
$GEN_054_UNIQUE_QUESTION_01
According to the testimony, what do the dogs do during the day?
$GEN_054_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_01_00
Stroll around Paris.
$GEN_054_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_00
They were on a chain.
$GEN_054_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_01
Beg for scraps around the neighbourhood.
