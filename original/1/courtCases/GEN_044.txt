	The 19-year-old <a name="1" class="hidden">widow of plotter</a> Count Cyrille de la Montange is accused of assaulting an officer. The incident took place during the public execution of her husband, who was sentenced to death three months earlier. According to the file, he was planning to assassinate the main leaders of the Revolution.
$GEN_044_DOC_01_01
	The decapitation took place in front of the Paris City Hall. Soon afterwards, the Captain of the National Guard, Roger Plessis, lost an eye, allegedly at the hands of Countess de la Montagne. It is said that the Countess <a name="3" class="hidden">led a commotion</a> in the crowd and then <a name="4" class="hidden">cast a stone</a> in the direction of Captain Plessis, who was standing on the scaffold. The victim saw her in the crowd and the Countess was immediately detained by the Guards who were keeping watch during the execution.
$GEN_044_DOC_01_02
	Everything points to the fact that the Captain's injury was not collateral damage, but the direct result of de la Montagne's deliberate attack. It was him who <a name="5" class="hidden">discovered the plot</a> and arrested the Count and four of his accomplices, all aristocrats related to the pre-Revolutionary royal court.

	Now deprived of one of his eyes, Captain Plessis ignores the sex, age, and pregnancy of the Countess, accusing her of Counter-Revolutionary activity and demanding the highest punishment for her.
$GEN_044_OnStart_00
Kill the Counter-Revolutionary!
$GEN_044_OnStart_01
Away with the aristocracy!
$GEN_044_OnStart_02
Are they insane?
$GEN_044_OnStart_03
Judge Nanou smartly shirked this trial, pointing at his kinship with Captain Plessis. He stated, “I cannot be the judge in the trial of my cousin. A distant cousin, but a cousin nonetheless.”
$GEN_044_OnStart_04
Bloody coward… Citizen, what is your name?
$GEN_044_OnStart_05
Countess Isabelle de la Montagne. Do not think that I am threatened by your stern face. My family and I have already been hurt enough by your… Revolution.
$GEN_044_OnStart_06
Did you hear that audacious cow?!
$GEN_044_OnStart_07
Order! The accused is advised to cooperate with the court. Remember that your life is not the only one at stake.
$GEN_044_OnStart_08
Neither I, nor my unborn child, are guilty of Plessis’s disability.
$GEN_044_OnStart_09
Sure, the stone threw itself through the air to smash my eye! Also, it is simply outrageous of you to hide behind an unborn child. You should be ashamed!
$GEN_044_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Citizen Isabelle de la Montagne to death! Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_044_OnGuilty_01
A perfect ending for the aristocracy and their bastards!
$GEN_044_OnGuilty_02
The evidence was strong, justice prevailed.
$GEN_044_OnPrison_00
I sentence Citizen Isabelle de la Montagne to prison! Take the convict away.
$GEN_044_OnPrison_01
She should lose her head!
$GEN_044_OnPrison_02
That’s because she’s an aristocrat! A regular person would be hanged!
$GEN_044_OnPrison_03
Their child was given a chance. Let us hope it will not be wasted.
$GEN_044_OnNotGuilty_00
The verdict in the case of Countess Isabelle de la Montagne is… not guilty! Lead the defendant out.
$GEN_044_OnNotGuilty_01
What a coward!
$GEN_044_OnNotGuilty_02
Are aristocrats still so privileged?
$GEN_044_OnNotGuilty_03
Away with a law like that!
$GEN_044_02x04_00_QTitle
Did you throw the stone that hurt the victim?
$GEN_044_02x04_00_00
Did you throw the stone that hurt the victim?
$GEN_044_02x04_00_01
I do not know who cast it, but I am glad they did not miss.
$GEN_044_02x04_00_02
The Captain claims it was you. It is hard not to believe him since he was observing the whole event from the scaffold.
$GEN_044_02x04_00_03
Look at me, and look closely. I am not well built, I am five months into my pregnancy, and I was cut off from the scaffold by soldiers and the crowd. He was at least 20 yards away. How could I hit him from that far?
$GEN_044_02x04_00_04
You were acting with heated emotions, and they are known to reveal unexpected strength.
$GEN_044_02x04_00_05
I was unable to do anything but cry!
$GEN_044_02x04_00_06
You were as angry as you are now.
$GEN_044_02x04_00_07
You say so, but anger would be justified in a situation like that, and people can do many things when angry.
$GEN_044_03x04_01_QTitle
Did you incite a riot to carry out your revenge on the victim?
$GEN_044_03x04_01_00
Did you incite a riot to carry out your revenge on the victim?
$GEN_044_03x04_01_01
I did not incite anything. All that I remember was falling on a man standing behind me… There was a fight… And then the soldiers pulled me from the crowd.
$GEN_044_03x04_01_02
So you do not remember much.
$GEN_044_03x04_01_03
No.
$GEN_044_03x04_01_04
Then you cannot be certain that you did not cast the stone.
$GEN_044_01x05_02_QTitle
Do you admit to throwing a stone in the direction of the victim…
$GEN_044_01x05_02_00
Do you admit to throwing a stone in the direction of the victim because he was responsible for your husband’s death?
$GEN_044_01x05_02_01
Regretfully, I am not responsible for hurting that scoundrel. He should be the one decapitated – for more reasons than just my husband’s death.
$GEN_044_01x05_02_02
What do you mean?
$GEN_044_01x05_02_03
I gave myself to him! I did it because he promised my husband immunity in exchange, and now I am pregnant with his child! Do you want to say something, Plessis, you bastard?!
$GEN_044_01x05_02_04
She’s lying, that bloody bitch!
$GEN_044_01x05_02_05
It is a lie, monsieur le juge! You should gag her!
$GEN_044_01x05_02_06
Any woman could say that. We must have evidence.
$GEN_044_01x05_02_07
I will give birth to that child, Plessis, so that everyone can see the resemblance!
$GEN_044_01x05_02_08
Order, order! Do I really need to repeat myself? Bring in Captain Plessis as a witness.
$GEN_044_01x03_03_QTitle
Describe your involvement in the riot.
$GEN_044_01x03_03_00
Describe your involvement in the riot.
$GEN_044_01x03_03_01
I was not at all involved! Why would I incite or take part in it? Would that bring my husband back to life?
$GEN_044_01x03_03_02
Considering the Count’s crimes, it is hard to believe that his wife would not be prone to activities that endanger public safety.
$GEN_044_01x03_03_03
I had nothing to do with my husband’s activities. My only guilt, as you can see, is being born in court and not in some marketplace…
$GEN_044_WIT_00_A_QTitle
How would you comment upon the remarkable statement given by the defendant?
$GEN_044_WIT_00_A_00
How would you comment upon the remarkable statement given by the defendant?
$GEN_044_WIT_00_A_01
The sheer fact that you are asking me about this is a scandal! On my honour, I did not fill the belly of that witch!
$GEN_044_WIT_00_A_02
The defendant seems rather certain of it. Did you have intercourse? Did you accept such a dishonourable bribe?
$GEN_044_WIT_00_A_03
I have lost an eye! How am I supposed to serve the country now?
$GEN_044_WIT_00_A_04
Answer the question!
$GEN_044_WIT_00_A_05
The defendant visited me the day before her husband’s trial and asked me to intercede on his behalf. I refused.
$GEN_044_WIT_01_A_QTitle
Then whose child is that?
$GEN_044_WIT_01_A_00
Then whose child is that?
$GEN_044_WIT_01_A_01
The treacherous Count’s, I assume. He was decapitated three months ago. He surely had some fun before…
$GEN_044_WIT_01_A_02
The plotter was decapitated three months ago, but his arrest took place five months ago.
$GEN_044_WIT_01_A_03
Then he got her pregnant immediately before the arrest!
$GEN_044_WIT_01_A_04
Or perhaps you did immediately after the arrest.
$GEN_044_WIT_01_A_05
Scandalous! Any minute now I will demand satisfaction!
$GEN_044_WIT_01_A_06
Here, in court, it is us who demand something from you, and not the other way around!
$GEN_044_WIT_01_B_QTitle
How can you be so sure that it was the accused who threw the stone?
$GEN_044_WIT_01_B_00
How can you be so sure that it was the accused who threw the stone? I heard there were many people crowded around the gallows.
$GEN_044_WIT_01_B_01
Only one stone was thrown. People were hitting each other, but nobody would dare raise their hand against an officer who was only following orders.
$GEN_044_WIT_01_B_02
That does not prove anything.
$GEN_044_WIT_01_B_03
No, it does not, but when a woman yells, “Death to the treacherous Guards!” right after you beheaded her husband, there is no better explanation.
$GEN_044_WIT_01_B_04
Did you see it?
$GEN_044_WIT_01_B_05
I saw her, and I saw the stone coming from where she was standing.
$GEN_044_WIT_01_B_06
What’s there to think about?

$GEN_044_UNIQUE_QUESTION_00
How did the Countess try to bribe Officer Plessis?
$GEN_044_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_00_00
She gave herself to him.
$GEN_044_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_00_00
She gave him gold.
$GEN_044_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_00_01
She gifted her house to him.
$GEN_044_UNIQUE_QUESTION_01
According to the witness, what was the defendant yelling?
$GEN_044_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_01_00
Death to the treacherous guards!
$GEN_044_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_00
Die, Plessis!
$GEN_044_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_01
Away with the Revolution!
