	As we have been informed by the inhabitants of the Latin Quarter, a certain <a name="1" class="hidden">freak</a> and <a name="2" class="hidden">recluse</a> has poisoned a local well that is used by a couple of nearby tenements. As can be read in the denunciation, several Citizens have suffered with illness as a result of this crime.
$GEN_056_DOC_01_01
	The defendant is Gabriel Rouzet, and the soldier sent to arrest him confirmed the neighbours’ opinion about his eccentricity. The man lives with <a name="3" class="hidden">two servants</a> on the fourth floor of a building on rue Serpente. At the moment of arrest, his apartment was in <a name="4" class="hidden">complete darkness</a> and the external appearance and behaviour of the host was described as repugnant. You will be able to observe it yourself in the courtroom.

	Authorities of Paris, in the last few days the water in <a name="5" class="hidden">our well</a> started to stink. It’s so bad that some folk even started paying carriers to get water from the public fountain by the university. Those who drank the well water <a name="7" class="hidden">fell ill</a>, some worse than others. One fellow by the name of Lambert Cazale, my friend, vomited into a bucket all night long. It had to be cleaned up, of course.
$GEN_056_DOC_02_02
	There’s no doubt about who’s behind the poisoning of the well. Across the street lives Rouzet, an ugly pig and a freak. He only leaves the house in the evenings, and even though he covers his face we know what kind of monster he is. There’s no doubt hates people, and probably threw a <a name="8" class="hidden">dead body</a> in there so we don’t have anything to drink and we drop like flies. And the freak himself started taking water from the public fountain!
$GEN_056_OnStart_00
I cannot be certain, but I suppose anything could have fallen into the well, even a careless cat.
$GEN_056_OnStart_01
Is your name Rouzet?
$GEN_056_OnStart_02
Yes, Gabriel Rouzet.
$GEN_056_OnStart_03
You are accused of poisoning the well. Would you like to say anything in your defence?
$GEN_056_OnStart_04
Ever since I was a child I’ve had skin problems from exposure to light.
$GEN_056_OnStart_05
Does this disease have anything to do with your… appearance?
$GEN_056_OnStart_06
Probably. I wasn’t born this way.
$GEN_056_OnStart_07
Did you poison the well or not?
$GEN_056_OnStart_08
Of course I didn’t. What an absurd accusation.
$GEN_056_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Citizen Rouzet to the guillotine. He will not be terrorising any more Citizens.
$GEN_056_OnGuilty_01
Justice is served at last!
$GEN_056_OnGuilty_02
We’re finally getting rid of him!
$GEN_056_OnPrison_00
Citizen Rouzet, I sentence you to 10 years in prison.
$GEN_056_OnPrison_01
Good, they’ll know what to do with him in there!
$GEN_056_OnNotGuilty_00
Citizen Rouzet is not guilty of poisoning the well, release him.
$GEN_056_OnNotGuilty_01
The well didn’t poison itself!

Is that surprising?
$GEN_056_01x04_00_02
Have you ever caused anyone harm?
$GEN_056_01x04_00_03
I suffer enough as it is, there is no need to harass others.

People are disturbed by your permanently covered windows.

Fortunately, I can.

His Lordship Monster wears fustian!
$GEN_056_06x03_01_03
Silence in court. What is your profession?
$GEN_056_06x03_01_04
In my condition? Monsieur le juge, sometimes I can’t be far from the chamber pot for three days in a row, and then I spend the following two in bed.
$GEN_056_06x03_01_05
So you do not work?
$GEN_056_06x03_01_06
No.
$GEN_056_06x03_01_07
Then how do you support yourself?
$GEN_056_06x03_01_08
I inherited some money from my father. He was a manufacturer and I sold the factory after he died.
$GEN_056_06x03_01_09
The father an exploiter, and the son a freak!
$GEN_056_06x03_01_10
What do you do all day?
$GEN_056_06x03_01_11
I mostly read literature.

I would have that was obvious.
$GEN_056_02x07_02_02
Please answer and refrain from commenting. Do you dislike people?
$GEN_056_02x07_02_03
I did not poison the well.
$GEN_056_02x07_02_04
Your neighbours claim otherwise.
$GEN_056_02x07_02_05
If someone says they saw me, they’re lying like a mongrel dog.
$GEN_056_02x07_02_06
With contempt for people like that, they should cut his ugly head off.

Contempt? I’m the one who should be taking revenge for contempt. For women covering children’s faces whenever I pass, for my lonely childhood, for–

We are not discussing your life now, but the issue of the well being poisoned.
$GEN_056_02x07_02_09
Of course. Nobody ever talks about me. It’s as though you could get infected from merely saying the words. I am disgusted with all of you.
$GEN_056_02x07_02_10
As we are with you, monster!

Call in Lambert Cazale.
$GEN_056_01x07_03_02
Your name?
$GEN_056_01x07_03_03
Lambert Cazale, monsieur le juge.
$GEN_056_01x07_03_04
You have accused Citizen Rouzet of poisoning the well.
$GEN_056_01x07_03_05
I have, and I’m not ashamed of it!
$GEN_056_01x07_03_06
He did well!
$GEN_056_01x07_03_07
Have you been neighbours for a long time?
$GEN_056_01x07_03_08
For as long as I can remember.
$GEN_056_01x07_03_09
And he has not disturbed you so far?
$GEN_056_01x07_03_10
He sure has, but during the Ancien Régime no one paid attention to our denunciations.
$GEN_056_08x05_04_QTitle
Do you admit to poisoning the well with a corpse?
$GEN_056_08x05_04_00
Do you admit to poisoning the well with a corpse?
$GEN_056_08x05_04_01
No, that is absurd.
$GEN_056_08x05_04_02
Do you have evidence to support your innocence?
$GEN_056_08x05_04_03
Has anyone taken the trouble to pull that supposed corpse out of the water?
$GEN_056_08x05_04_04
It’s pitch-black down there in the well, can't see nothing.
$GEN_056_08x05_04_05
I am asking the questions here.
$GEN_056_08x05_04_06
No, I have no evidence of my innocence.
$GEN_056_03x05_05_QTitle
Do your servants carry water from the well for you?
$GEN_056_03x05_05_00
Do your servants carry water from the well for you?
$GEN_056_03x05_05_01
Usually they do.
$GEN_056_03x05_05_02
Why only usually?
$GEN_056_03x05_05_03
The well usually stank after it rained – so I would give them money to fetch water from the fountain.
$GEN_056_03x05_05_04
Did they also drink it?
$GEN_056_03x05_05_05
Of course. They are good women, they always eat and drink whatever I’m having.
$GEN_056_03x05_05_06
The monster’s sluts. I wonder what else they did together.
$GEN_056_02x04_06_QTitle
Do you avoid your neighbours?
$GEN_056_02x04_06_00
Do you avoid your neighbours?
$GEN_056_02x04_06_01
Yes, as they do me.
$GEN_056_02x04_06_02
Have people ever tried to remove you from the neighbourhood?
$GEN_056_02x04_06_03
Certainly. I’ve lost count of how many times.
$GEN_056_02x04_06_04
Can you elaborate? What exactly did they do?
$GEN_056_02x04_06_05
I could go on for some time. They threw stones at my windows, threatened my servants, there was one sadist who beat my dog to death with a stick when I was 15 years old. Should I continue? Once, when I decided to take an evening walk, I had to escape from–
$GEN_056_02x04_06_06
I understand, you can stop there.
$GEN_056_02x04_06_07
He’s making that up!
$GEN_056_02x04_06_08
I wish I were.

$GEN_056_WIT_00_A_00
Did you witness Rouzet poisoning the well?
$GEN_056_WIT_00_A_01
No, but it couldn’t have been anyone else.
$GEN_056_WIT_00_A_02
Why is that?
$GEN_056_WIT_00_A_03
Everyone around is normal, while this one… just look at him. He’s not even human!
$GEN_056_WIT_00_A_04
Not human?
$GEN_056_WIT_00_A_05
He’s a revenant – he crawled from a grave to scare people!
$GEN_056_WIT_00_B_QTitle
Has the rancid water made you sick?
$GEN_056_WIT_00_B_00
Has the rancid water made you sick?
$GEN_056_WIT_00_B_01
That it has.
$GEN_056_WIT_00_B_02
Were you able to smell it?
$GEN_056_WIT_00_B_03
Several streets away.
$GEN_056_WIT_00_B_04
So why did you drink it?
$GEN_056_WIT_00_B_05
That water always stinks, so I didn't notice that now it also stinks of poison.
