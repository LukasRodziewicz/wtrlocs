	Marc Pinnet is a 42-year-old widower and a master of gunpowder production. The craftsman’s employees like him, he is generally respected, and he has never been in trouble with the law. Yet two of his female employees have accused him of <a name="4" class="hidden">rape</a>. 
$GEN_051_DOC_01_01
	Because of the current high demand for gunpowder in Paris, the shop is working day and night and employs twice as many people as usual. Citizens Vaganay and Bacque have been working there for only a few weeks and had not met before.
$GEN_051_DOC_01_02
	Marc Pinnet allegedly assaulted both of them during their night shifts in the storehouse behind <a name="3" class="hidden">the mill</a>. They testified that he threatened them with a knife and ordered them to enter the storehouse and get undressed. After he finished, he gave both of them <a name="5" class="hidden">a few copper coins</a>. 
$GEN_051_DOC_01_03
	They only dared to denounce him after a few days when they found out about each other’s terrible experiences.
$GEN_051_DOC_01_04
	We wish to express our solidarity with the defenders of Paris and ask for the quick resolution of Marc Pinnet’s trial. Gunpowder is currently more important to us than gold.
$GEN_051_OnStart_00
Are you Citizen Pinnet?
$GEN_051_OnStart_01
That I am.
$GEN_051_OnStart_02
You have been accused of rape by two Citizens.
$GEN_051_OnStart_03
This is a misunderstanding. I paid them what they were due. Why are they now holding a grudge against me?
$GEN_051_OnStart_04
Did they ask you for that money?
$GEN_051_OnStart_05
If they didn’t, they wouldn’t have put it in their pockets, would they?
$GEN_051_OnStart_06
They claim that you threatened them with a knife.
$GEN_051_OnStart_07
I always carry it, but I didn’t threaten anyone.
$GEN_051_OnGuilty_00
He who hurts one Parisian woman hurts us all. Send him to the guillotine.
$GEN_051_OnGuilty_01
I have nothing to add.
$GEN_051_OnGuilty_02
A specialist killed over such a trivial thing?
$GEN_051_OnGuilty_03
I wonder who will make powder for our cannons now?
$GEN_051_OnNotGuilty_00
The case appears to be a common misunderstanding. You are free to go, Citizen Pinnet.
$GEN_051_OnNotGuilty_01
I hope that misunderstandings like this are not so common.
$GEN_051_OnNotGuilty_02
Correct!
$GEN_051_OnNotGuilty_03
They thought they could defame such a good man.
$GEN_051_04x06_00_QTitle
Citizen Bacque, please come closer.
$GEN_051_04x06_00_00
Citizen Bacque, please come closer.
$GEN_051_01x03_01_QTitle
How long have you been working in the factory?
$GEN_051_01x03_01_00
How long have you been working in the factory?
$GEN_051_01x03_01_01
All my life, monsieur le juge. I started as an apprentice, so I even remember when we switched to steam.
$GEN_051_01x03_01_02
Can you describe how gunpowder is made?
$GEN_051_01x03_01_03
You have to mill the ingredients really fine using special rollers, though sometimes people wrongly call them grinders.
$GEN_051_01x03_01_04
Then what?
$GEN_051_01x03_01_05
You mix everything according to the proportions, and then add a little water to the mixture. Then you squeeze it through a special sieve that lets through tiny lumps.
$GEN_051_01x03_01_06
It does not sound like a complicated process.
$GEN_051_01x03_01_07
I’m not appreciated because it’s difficult, but because every day the number of employees leaving work needs to be the same as the number of those who entered it in the morning. In a place like that, it’s real easy to cause an explosion.
$GEN_051_01x03_01_08
Yet, some days, your employees leave work disgraced.
$GEN_051_01x03_01_09
Good women don’t come to work in the factory. The ones I hire have already gotten themselves disgraced.
$GEN_051_02x05_02_QTitle
If you were ready to pay for love, why did you threaten those women with a knife?
$GEN_051_02x05_02_00
If you were ready to pay for love, why did you threaten those women with a knife?
$GEN_051_02x05_02_01
I didn’t threaten anyone.
$GEN_051_02x05_02_02
Why would he lie?
$GEN_051_02x05_02_03
Then why have they accused you?
$GEN_051_02x05_02_04
How would I know? They probably want more money.
$GEN_051_02x05_02_05
You are facing the guillotine, not a fine.
$GEN_051_02x05_02_06
Why do you carry a knife around the factory?
$GEN_051_02x05_02_07
It’s good to have one. It comes in handy when you need to lever something or check the quality of powder.
$GEN_051_02x05_02_08
Did you have it during the incident?
$GEN_051_02x05_02_09
Yes, but I did not take it out.
$GEN_051_02x05_02_10
You could have threatened them without showing it.
$GEN_051_02x05_02_11
If they’re stupid, you can scare someone with a shoehorn.
$GEN_051_03x02_03_QTitle
You took Citizens Bacque and Vaganay to the storehouse behind the mill. Why there?
$GEN_051_03x02_03_00
You took Citizens Bacque and Vaganay to the storehouse behind the mill. Why there?
$GEN_051_03x02_03_01
We keep sacks there and you can lie on them comfortably.
$GEN_051_03x02_03_02
How loud is the mill?
$GEN_051_03x02_03_03
Quite loud.
$GEN_051_03x02_03_04
Loud enough to drown out screams?
$GEN_051_03x02_03_05
Is that not obvious?
$GEN_051_03x02_03_06
Love needs a little privacy.
$GEN_051_03x02_03_07
He’s right.
$GEN_051_03x02_03_08
Why did you not invite them to your place after work? You would have had even more privacy.
$GEN_051_03x02_03_09
…
$GEN_051_03x02_03_10
Pardon?
$GEN_051_03x02_03_11
I never thought of it.
$GEN_051_03x02_03_12
And they did not suggest it when you politely spoke to them before the act?
$GEN_051_03x02_03_13
…
$GEN_051_03x02_03_14
As I thought – there was no conversation.
$GEN_051_06x05_04_QTitle
These women accuse you of a horrible crime.
$GEN_051_06x05_04_00
These women accuse you of a horrible crime. Is there anything you would like to say in your defence?
$GEN_051_06x05_04_01
You know women, monsieur le juge, they are never sure what they want.
$GEN_051_06x05_04_02
I am sure they did not want to be raped.
$GEN_051_06x05_04_03
Maybe I was a bit straightforward, but is that really so bad? They didn’t yell or cry, and they took the money. What’s the problem?
$GEN_051_06x05_04_04
Do I really have to explain it to you?
$GEN_051_06x05_04_05
They wanted it at first, but then they got scared their bellies might swell and their husbands might find out. Easier to blame the guy, no? Because everyone always feels sorry for the women, and so what if I lose my head.
$GEN_051_WIT_00_A_QTitle
Night shifts at a powder mill does not sound like work for women.
$GEN_051_WIT_00_A_00
Night shifts at a powder mill does not sound like work for women.
$GEN_051_WIT_00_A_01
There’s a high demand for powder, so they pay good money for the night shifts.
$GEN_051_WIT_00_A_02
Did you need money?
$GEN_051_WIT_00_A_03
Who doesn’t? Everything is so expensive now.
$GEN_051_WIT_00_A_04
Did Citizen Pinnet offer you money in exchange for satisfying his urges?
$GEN_051_WIT_00_A_05
No, monsieur le juge. He just came with the knife.
$GEN_051_WIT_00_A_06
Did you take the money?
$GEN_051_WIT_00_A_07
I have it with me. If you like, you can give it to some poor children, monsieur le juge. Or just shove it down that man’s throat.
$GEN_051_WIT_00_A_08
Why did you accept it in the first place?
$GEN_051_WIT_00_A_09
I don’t know, everything happened so fast. I barely even remember putting my clothes back on…
$GEN_051_WIT_01_A_QTitle
Did you try to defend yourself, or scream?
$GEN_051_WIT_01_A_00
Did you try to defend yourself, or scream?
$GEN_051_WIT_01_A_01
…
$GEN_051_WIT_01_A_02
I know it is hard to go back to that moment, but it is important.
$GEN_051_WIT_01_A_03
I could have tried, but it wouldn’t have helped. The mills make such a noise, who would have heard?
$GEN_051_WIT_01_A_04
Did you defend yourself?
$GEN_051_WIT_01_A_05
If she really wanted to defend herself, she wouldn’t work with men all night.
$GEN_051_WIT_01_A_06
I was barely able to move my hands after the shift. He’s a large chap, he can afford meat, and he grabbed my neck with one hand. If he wanted to, he could have broken it as easily as a dove’s neck.
$GEN_051_WIT_01_A_08
Would you like to comment on that?
$GEN_051_WIT_01_A_09
She wasn’t tearing herself away from me, and I couldn’t hear her in the storehouse. She should have said something before we went in there.
$GEN_051_WIT_01_B_QTitle
Why did you wait so long before making the denunciation?
$GEN_051_WIT_01_B_00
Why did you wait so long before making the denunciation?
$GEN_051_WIT_01_B_01
I was afraid.
$GEN_051_WIT_01_B_02
Did you continue to work after the incident?
$GEN_051_WIT_01_B_03
Yes, I really need the money. I have young brothers and my father suffers from breathing troubles and can’t work.
$GEN_051_WIT_01_B_04
No wonder she went with the master for a couple of sous.
$GEN_051_WIT_01_B_05
What made you change your mind?
$GEN_051_WIT_01_B_06
Even my father said that I should let it go. But then I saw how Marie, I mean Citizen Vaganay, was looking at him… and I realised that I wasn’t alone. To do it by yourself is hard, but when there’s two of you… You understand what I’m talking about, don’t you?
$GEN_051_WIT_01_B_08
Would you like to comment on that?
$GEN_051_WIT_01_B_09
