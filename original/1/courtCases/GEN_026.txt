Gaston de Toucy, Viscount de Poissy, 37-year-old captain of the artillery. Unlike other officers from the aristocracy, he did not flee France once the Revolution began and instead continued his military career. He became famous after the Battle of Valmy, which halted the advance of the Prussian and Austrian armies. He is currently commanding the cannon company of the 39th demi-brigade which is stationed in the vicinity of Paris. He is generally considered to be <a name="1" class="hidden">an experienced officer</a>, although his past <a name="2" class="hidden">alcoholism</a> casts a shadow upon his reputation.
$GEN_026_DOC_01_01
As an officer, he has been tasked with transferring the company’s cannon to the site of the mass-execution of Counter-Revolutionaries. The Bicêtre prison warden, Alfons d’Outre, has accused him of intentionally losing the cannon during the march and <a name="3" class="hidden">sabotaging the verdicts</a> of the Revolutionary Tribunal.
$GEN_026_DOC_01_02
Against protocol, de Toucy issued <a name="4" class="hidden">an order to transport</a> the cannon crew on the company’s vehicles, separate from the cannon, which were transported later with the food supply. This resulted in the cannon being found in the vicinity of Vaubourg, far from Porcherons, where the condemned were scheduled to be shot. When the cannon crew finally arrived, Captain de Toucy was drunk. The soldiers testified that de Toucy <a name="5" class="hidden">changed the route of the transport</a> with Sergeant Foute after the marching had already started.
$GEN_026_DOC_01_03
D’Outre claims that de Toucy arranged the operation, because a certain Quentin de Laval, his <a name="6" class="hidden">comrade in arms</a>, was among the condemned. De Toucy and de Laval fought together in the Army of the North. During the battle of Valmy, de Laval carried the Viscount on his back in the middle of Prussian artillery fire.
$GEN_026_DOC_01_04
At first, de Toucy was supposed to face court martial, but given the Counter-Revolutionary character of his charges, it was decided he should instead answer to the Revolutionary Tribunal.
$GEN_026_OnStart_00
Please introduce yourself.
$GEN_026_OnStart_01
Captain Gaston de Toucy, cannon company, 39th demi-brigade.
$GEN_026_OnStart_02
I remind the accused that he faces the court as an ordinary Citizen, stripped of all privileges resulting from his rank and suspended as a soldier pending the conclusion of this trial.
$GEN_026_OnStart_03
If I may – I was not awarded my rank by the court, so the court will not tell me if I am an officer or not.
$GEN_026_OnStart_04
You are answering for insubordination and conduct not befitting of an officer – contain yourself.
$GEN_026_OnStart_05
You are accused of using your position to obstruct the execution of Counter-Revolutionaries. Do you plead guilty?
$GEN_026_OnStart_06
No. It is shit produced by the arse that is Citizen d’Outre.
$GEN_026_OnStart_07
They should behead you for that filthy mouth!
$GEN_026_OnStart_08
It is you who should be beheaded, you cowardly sluggards! You shout here, but I did not see you on the Prussian front!
$GEN_026_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Gaston de Toucy to be guillotined! Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_026_OnGuilty_01
Fortunately, you were able to weed out de Toucy before he failed our army on the battlefield.
$GEN_026_OnGuilty_02
Well done!
$GEN_026_OnGuilty_03
You’re killing a defender of France!
$GEN_026_OnGuilty_04
Bravo!
$GEN_026_OnNotGuilty_00
The judgement for Gaston de Toucy is… not guilty! Set the defendant free.
$GEN_026_OnNotGuilty_01
Even if you are not convinced he was conspiring, you should put him in prison for his stupidity.
$GEN_026_OnNotGuilty_02
Outrageous!
$GEN_026_OnNotGuilty_03
This court knows no justice!
$GEN_026_OnNotGuilty_04
Are you stupid?! Can’t you see he’s guilty?!
$GEN_026_01x03_00_QTitle
I find it surprising that an experienced officer would not foresee provisions…
$GEN_026_01x03_00_00
I find it surprising that an experienced officer would not foresee provisions and cannon being unable to keep up with lighter vehicles.
$GEN_026_01x03_00_01
I did not expect that Sergeant Foute would get lost in well-known terrain and lead the transport to Vaubourg instead of Porcherons.
$GEN_026_01x03_00_02
I believe the accused did what he could to “lose” the cannon so they would not arrive at the site of the execution.
$GEN_026_01x03_00_03
Why would I do that? D’Outre could easily ask for another company of six-pounders. It would not help anyone, especially the condemned.
$GEN_026_01x03_00_04
Maybe the delay of the execution was part of your plan.
$GEN_026_01x03_00_05
What plan?
$GEN_026_01x03_00_06
Did you intend to free the condemned?
$GEN_026_01x03_00_07
Nonsense.
$GEN_026_01x03_00_08
Make him spit out his collaborators!
$GEN_026_01x04_01_QTitle
Why did you not follow protocol and order the crew to march with their cannon?
$GEN_026_01x04_01_00
Why did you not follow protocol and order the crew to march with their cannon?
$GEN_026_01x04_01_01
According to Colonel Fabron’s order, the company was to arrive at Porcherons within a day. That was impossible. We would not have made it in time if we had marched from the training ground following protocol.
$GEN_026_01x04_01_02
Colonel Fabron made no mention of disregarding the standard marching procedure in his order.
$GEN_026_01x04_01_03
There was, however, a strong indication that the Tribunal’s verdict could not wait and that I should hurry. The order was clear and the circumstances were extraordinary, so I did all I could to carry it out.
$GEN_026_01x04_01_04
Separating the crew from the cannon was supposed to hasten the march?
$GEN_026_01x04_01_05
…
$GEN_026_01x04_01_06
I would be interested to hear your explanation.
$GEN_026_01x04_01_07
The crew would have been able to carry out the execution without the cannon.
$GEN_026_01x04_01_08
I remember a very different plan.
$GEN_026_01x04_01_09
I wanted to follow my orders as closely as possible.
$GEN_026_03x06_02_QTitle
What would you do to help a comrade in arms whose life is in danger?
$GEN_026_03x06_02_00
What would you do to help a comrade in arms whose life is in danger?
$GEN_026_03x06_02_01
Whatever I could.
$GEN_026_03x06_02_02
So the accused would not hesitate to sabotage the execution of Quentin de Laval, to whom he owes his life?
$GEN_026_03x06_02_03
Sabotaging Lieutenant de Laval’s execution would merely postpone it, not change the decision of the Tribunal.
$GEN_026_03x06_02_04
But it would clear your conscience, as you would not participate in his death. I believe that is a good enough excuse for losing the cannon.
$GEN_026_03x06_02_05
In my opinion, we are dealing with a plot. He wanted to free de Laval.
$GEN_026_03x06_02_06
Imputation and speculation. Where is your evidence?
$GEN_026_03x06_02_07
If we dismiss all the absurd possibilities, only a Counter-Revolutionary plot remains. Give me the names of your collaborators!
$GEN_026_03x06_02_08
I have no idea what you are talking about.
$GEN_026_03x06_02_09
Monarchist fat heads have nothing better to do than plot.
$GEN_026_02x01_03_QTitle
I wonder why, after such a long time of sobriety, you decided to get drunk precisely when…
$GEN_026_02x01_03_00
I wonder why, after such a long time of sobriety, you decided to get drunk precisely when carrying out Colonel Fabron’s order.
$GEN_026_02x01_03_01
It was a moment of personal weakness. That is the only thing I can admit to.
$GEN_026_02x01_03_02
Was that momentary weakness also responsible for you ordering Sergeant Foute to send the cannon to Vaubourg instead of Porcherons?
$GEN_026_02x01_03_03
I do not remember giving such an order. Who said that?
$GEN_026_02x01_03_04
Your subordinates. The court believes that you wanted to use your intoxication as an alibi after redirecting the transport of the cannon.
$GEN_026_02x01_03_05
Or perhaps he needed to drown his fear of the infallible hand of justice.
$GEN_026_02x01_03_06
You arses know nothing about justice.
$GEN_026_02x01_03_07
Cease your impudence or we will teach you about discipline! Were you drinking to cover up your true intentions?
$GEN_026_02x01_03_08
That is an unjust misinterpretation of the facts.
$GEN_026_02x01_03_09
We have no use for such a defender!
$GEN_026_02x01_03_10
At least he fought against the Prussians.
$GEN_026_03x04_04_QTitle
Call in the witness, Olivier Foute.
$GEN_026_03x04_04_00
Call in the witness, Olivier Foute.
$GEN_026_03x04_04_02
Please introduce yourself.
$GEN_026_03x04_04_03
Sergeant Olivier Foute, 2nd section of the 39th demi-brigade’s 1st artillery company.
$GEN_026_04x05_05_QTitle
Why did the artillerymen march before the cannon?
$GEN_026_04x05_05_00
Why did the artillerymen march before the cannon?
$GEN_026_04x05_05_01
Because they were ready to leave earlier. The gunners had to prepare the carriages and take the case-shot from the arsenal in order to realise d’Outre’s dream of becoming the second Fouché.
$GEN_026_04x05_05_02
You did not like the execution order?
$GEN_026_04x05_05_03
The army is supposed to fight, not torture defenceless people.
$GEN_026_04x05_05_04
Those defenceless people posed a threat to France.
$GEN_026_04x05_05_05
They deserved to be shot.
$GEN_026_04x05_05_06
I was given an order and tried to carry it out. You asked for my opinion, so I gave it to you.
$GEN_026_03x06_06_QTitle
Did the accused intentionally direct the cannon to Vaubourg to obstruct the execution of Quentin de Laval?
$GEN_026_03x06_06_00
Did the accused intentionally direct the cannon to Vaubourg to obstruct the execution of Quentin de Laval?
$GEN_026_03x06_06_01
I did not know that Colonel Laval was among the condemned.
$GEN_026_03x06_06_02
So it was just stupidity?
$GEN_026_03x06_06_03
I would rather say it was a mistake.
$GEN_026_03x06_06_04
True, people make mistakes.
$GEN_026_03x06_06_05
In war, mistakes like that can cost our soldiers their lives.
$GEN_026_03x06_06_06
I admit that as an officer I am guilty, but I did not have ill intentions.
$GEN_026_03x06_06_07
You should herd horses, not lead soldiers!
$GEN_026_WIT_00_A_QTitle
Witness, where were you supposed to lead the cannon transport?
$GEN_026_WIT_00_A_00
Witness, where were you supposed to lead the cannon transport?
$GEN_026_WIT_00_A_01
The Captain said we should all be in Porcherons at 9 a.m. or we’d be guillotined.
$GEN_026_WIT_00_A_02
Comrades of the witness testified that at some point the accused changed the destination of the transport, sending it to Vaubourg instead of Porcherons.
$GEN_026_WIT_00_A_03
The Captain joined us during a break, took me to one side, and said we had the wrong orders and should head to Vaubourg. He stank like a brewery.
$GEN_026_WIT_00_A_04
And still you believed him?
$GEN_026_WIT_00_A_05
The officers are constantly drunk, but we have to listen to them anyway.
$GEN_026_WIT_01_A_QTitle
Does the accused often abuse alcohol?
$GEN_026_WIT_01_A_00
Does the accused often abuse alcohol?
$GEN_026_WIT_01_A_01
To be honest, I haven’t seen him drunk in a while. I know that when he gives in, he really can’t hold his liquor though.
$GEN_026_WIT_01_A_02
Could he have had a reason to drink that day?
$GEN_026_WIT_01_A_03
No idea. Maybe he felt bad about de Laval?
$GEN_026_WIT_01_A_04
Did he talk about that?
$GEN_026_WIT_01_A_05
Certainly not to a common soldier like me.
$GEN_026_WIT_01_B_QTitle
What do you know about the relationship between the accused and Quentin de Laval?
$GEN_026_WIT_01_B_00
What do you know about the relationship between the accused and Quentin de Laval?
$GEN_026_WIT_01_B_01
De Laval rescued his life in Valmy, the whole unit knows that. After he was moved to our demi-brigade, they kept writing letters to each other.
$GEN_026_WIT_01_B_02
Did the accused know about de Laval’s sentence?
$GEN_026_WIT_01_B_03
I guess so, since he was so downbeat… But he never spoke about it. He’s a soldier, not a politician.
$GEN_026_WIT_01_B_04
Could he have known that de Laval was being kept in Bicêtre with the other condemned who were awaiting their execution?
$GEN_026_WIT_01_B_05
He certainly knew that de Laval was in Bicêtre, but I doubt he knew he’d be shot. I think he could have guessed it though.
$GEN_026_WIT_01_B_06
Could you explain?
$GEN_026_WIT_01_B_07
When he came to change the destination from Porcherons to Vaubourg, he was mumbling that he wouldn’t participate in something.
$GEN_026_WIT_01_B_08
Did he mention a plot, or any names?
$GEN_026_WIT_01_B_09
No, sir, I didn’t hear anything like that.

I will accept the verdict with dignity, but do not let that ease your conscience!
$GEN_026_UNIQUE_QUESTION_00
How did de Toucy explain his decision to separate the crew from the cannons?
$GEN_026_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_00_00
It was due to Colonel Fabron’s order.
$GEN_026_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_00_00
He followed procedure.
$GEN_026_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_00_01
He wanted to avoid sabotage.
$GEN_026_UNIQUE_QUESTION_01
Who was supposed to be executed?
$GEN_026_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_01_00
Counter-Revolutionaries.
$GEN_026_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_00
Priests.
$GEN_026_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_01
Common bandits.
$GEN_026_UNIQUE_QUESTION_02
How did the soldier describe the scheduled execution?
$GEN_026_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_02_00
Torturing defenceless people.
$GEN_026_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_02_00
A waste of gunpowder.
$GEN_026_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_02_01
A stain on the uniform.
