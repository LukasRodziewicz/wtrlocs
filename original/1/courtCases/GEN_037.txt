In the last two weeks, three female tenants of <a name="1" class="hidden">the same tenement</a>, Blandine Couturier, Abelone Macé, and Eugénie Marais, died. Their tragic demise has been preceded by the same dreadful symptoms: vomiting blood, convulsion, migraines, and severe muscle pain. The neighbours complained that they have suffered several sleepless nights because of their screams.
$GEN_037_DOC_01_01
The victims’ husbands have, after the fact, found out that their wives were clients of a certain Marie-Laure Thébault, who lives across the street. At home they found the same <a name="3" class="hidden">powder cases, lip rouge jars</a>, and other suspicious cosmetic products purchased from Thébault. Jean Macé brought all of them to the National Guard, along with a denunciation of widow Thébault, whom he accused of <a name="4" class="hidden">witchcraft</a>.
$GEN_037_DOC_01_02
In the neighbourhood, she is known as a resourceful elderly woman. At the age of 74, she still makes a living by selling blacking, rouge, and other mixtures supposed to enhance female beauty. Although she rarely left her house, <a name="6" class="hidden">her clients recommended her products</a> to their friends, who then visited her.
$GEN_037_DOC_01_03
The elderly woman did not resist when three soldiers arrested her. As she is <a name="7" class="hidden">visually impaired</a>, she did not realise that she was talking to the National Guard, and it was only when the men walked her from the apartment that she stopped asking them about the products she thought they wanted to buy.
$GEN_037_DOC_01_04
The soldiers informed the investigating officers about the suspicious jars filled with blood and bones that they saw on the shelves.

<a name="9" class="hidden">Jean Macé’s denunciation</a>:
$GEN_037_DOC_02_01
	As a Citizen who is obedient to the Revolution, I feel obliged to report that Thébault, a widow living in our neighbourhood, practices harmful witchcraft. Three hard-working Citizens of Paris have died in agony due to that woman’s magic and potions. All our neighbours know that her devilish wrongdoings have been the cause.

Jean Macé's denunciation
$GEN_037_OnStart_00
I am not one to believe in witchcraft. However, those deaths do not strike me as natural.
$GEN_037_OnStart_01
Are you Marie-Laure Thébault?
$GEN_037_OnStart_02
Yes, dear.
$GEN_037_OnStart_03
Do you live alone?
$GEN_037_OnStart_04
My husband never returned from the war in 1762. The former King sent him to Portugal where–
$GEN_037_OnStart_05
Were you somehow involved in the deaths of Blandine Couturier, Abelone Macé, and Eugénie Marais?
$GEN_037_OnStart_06
I would never hurt such good women.
$GEN_037_OnStart_07
And yet all were your clients, and they are all dead.
$GEN_037_OnStart_08
She poisoned them, like she’s poisoning us all!
$GEN_037_OnGuilty_00
For causing the terrible, painful death of three innocent women, I hereby sentence Marie-Laure Thébault to the guillotine!
$GEN_037_OnGuilty_01
Thank you for that just verdict.
$GEN_037_OnGuilty_02
We’ll come to see your head rolling down the pavement!
$GEN_037_OnGuilty_03
They should cover her in her own potions and let her die in pain!
$GEN_037_OnPrison_00
Marie-Laure Thébault, you will spend your remaining years in prison!
$GEN_037_OnPrison_01
Good thing she doesn’t have many of them left.
$GEN_037_OnPrison_02
That shrew deserves it!
$GEN_037_OnNotGuilty_00
Marie-Laure Thébault, I hereby declare you not guilty of the accused crimes. Let me put emphasis on the fact that Citizens of an enlightened France should not lower themselves to accusations of witchcraft.
$GEN_037_OnNotGuilty_01
She may not be a witch, but without a doubt she poisoned those women.
$GEN_037_OnNotGuilty_02
I could tell she’s a witch!
$GEN_037_02x06_00_QTitle
Do you have many clients?
$GEN_037_02x06_00_00
Do you have many clients?
$GEN_037_02x06_00_01
Not right now, dear, no. The guards won’t let them into my cell.
$GEN_037_02x06_00_02
Stop mocking the court. Do many women buy your powders?
$GEN_037_02x06_00_03
If they didn’t, I wouldn’t be able to afford butter. Many women visit me.
$GEN_037_02x06_00_04
Have they ever complained about your products?
$GEN_037_02x06_00_05
Never, dear. They always came back for more and gladly left their hard-earned money in my hands.
$GEN_037_02x06_00_06
Did they really always come back?
$GEN_037_02x06_00_07
Well, some did, some didn’t.
$GEN_037_02x06_00_08
I suppose some of them just died and nobody could ascertain why.
$GEN_037_02x06_00_09
She had it coming!
$GEN_037_01x03_01_QTitle
What did you sell to Citizens Couturier, Macé, and Marais?
$GEN_037_01x03_01_00
What did you sell to Citizens Couturier, Macé, and Marais?
$GEN_037_01x03_01_01
A bit of this and that. Who would remember the details?
$GEN_037_01x03_01_02
If you want to be freed by this court, you had better start remembering.
$GEN_037_01x03_01_03
I am sure they bought powder. Every woman buys powder, to be as pale as a countess.
$GEN_037_01x03_01_04
Many women bought it?
$GEN_037_01x03_01_05
Over the years, probably hundreds. I’ve nearly rubbed my hands to the bone mixing it.
$GEN_037_01x03_01_06
Dear God, we’re lucky they caught her.
$GEN_037_08x04_02_QTitle
How exactly do you prepare your cosmetics?
$GEN_037_08x04_02_00
How exactly do you prepare your cosmetics?
$GEN_037_08x04_02_01
Oh, you know, one way or another. My grandmother left me a thick notebook full of recipes. Sadly, I could read less and less. Not a single word in 15 years, I think. My eyes aren’t what they used to be.
$GEN_037_08x04_02_02
Then how do you mix your products?
$GEN_037_08x04_02_03
I remember everything that’s written there. I don’t need to read it.
$GEN_037_08x04_02_04
Need I repeat myself? I asked how exactly you prepare your cosmetics.
$GEN_037_08x04_02_05
I will tell you as if I were at confession. The face powder is no secret: you have to mix white lead with chalk. Lead is good, it purifies. You need strength to crush it, but I’m still able to do it. I’m used to it. I’ve been working my whole life.
$GEN_037_08x04_02_06
To the point, please.
$GEN_037_08x04_02_07
Lip rouge is a mixture of wax and carmine with a dash of spirit. Oh, how beautiful the red lips are of women who use it! The pigment isn’t easy to make, but I have my methods. You can cook a lizard or use the blood of a hedgehog, rat, or bat. You can also add a bit of sulphur to make the colour more durable.
$GEN_037_08x04_02_08
Bat’s blood and sulphur? She produces devilish potions, not cosmetics!
$GEN_037_07x05_03_QTitle
The soldiers reported that you did not recognise their uniforms.
$GEN_037_07x05_03_00
The soldiers reported that you did not recognise their uniforms.
$GEN_037_07x05_03_01
Dear, I can barely see you right now.
$GEN_037_07x05_03_02
How do you prepare your cosmetics if you cannot see what you are doing?
$GEN_037_07x05_03_03
I know the recipes by heart and recognise the ingredients by touch.
$GEN_037_07x05_03_04
And at no point have your clients complained that the powder painted their faces red?
$GEN_037_07x05_03_05
If anything like that happened, they’d simply go to someone else and take their money with them.
$GEN_037_07x05_03_06
What if you added too much of one of the ingredients?
$GEN_037_07x05_03_07
I suppose I sometimes pour more than I should, but I don’t mind. I am not a greedy person and I don’t stint my dear ladies, even though the ingredients aren’t cheap.
$GEN_037_02x04_04_QTitle
The husbands of the deceased accuse you of witchcraft. Is that true?
$GEN_037_02x04_04_00
The husbands of the deceased accuse you of witchcraft. Is that true?
$GEN_037_02x04_04_01
I can make the sign of the cross before you right now, dear!
$GEN_037_02x04_04_02
We will do without superstitions.
$GEN_037_02x04_04_03
Look at the walls of my apartment. Right over the table with my mortars and pestles hangs a cross. During the reign of King Louis–
$GEN_037_02x04_04_04
Don’t say one word too many, citizien.
$GEN_037_02x04_04_05
I’ll be as quiet as a church mouse.
$GEN_037_02x04_04_06
Why, no, continue. Are you a monarchist, citizen?
$GEN_037_02x04_04_07
That stinking King sent my dear husband to war, and to his death. The king, the revolution - same difference to me.
$GEN_037_02x04_04_08
That crone doesn’t know what she’s talking about.

Call in the witness, Jean Macé.
$GEN_037_04x09_05_00
Call in the witness, Jean Macé.
$GEN_037_04x09_05_02
Jean Macé, the late Abelone Macé’s husband, monsieur le juge.
$GEN_037_WIT_00_A_QTitle
Was your wife buying cosmetics from widow Thébault?
$GEN_037_WIT_00_A_00
Was your wife buying cosmetics from widow Thébault?
$GEN_037_WIT_00_A_01
Yes, I even gave her money to do so. She used to say that without the powder she felt like a peasant and was too embarrassed to leave our home.
$GEN_037_WIT_00_A_02
On what grounds do you believe that your wife was the victim of witchcraft?
$GEN_037_WIT_00_A_03
Our wives were healthy. They all gave birth, and without the help of a doctor. They were strong, hard-working. It must have been witchcraft.
$GEN_037_WIT_00_A_04
So your wife did not complain about her health?
$GEN_037_WIT_00_A_05
You know, she had her better and worse days, like we all do. But she never complained about anything serious!
$GEN_037_WIT_00_A_06
So the troubles started when she first applied cosmetics purchased from the widow?
$GEN_037_WIT_00_A_07
What do I know about when she–
$GEN_037_WIT_00_A_08
Focus!
$GEN_037_WIT_00_A_09
Yes, that’s how it went. I remember now. It all started when she bought those flasks.
$GEN_037_WIT_01_A_QTitle
Could you elaborate on the devilry that you referred to?
$GEN_037_WIT_01_A_00
Could you elaborate on the devilry that you referred to?
$GEN_037_WIT_01_A_01
You could smell sulphur in the backyard. Everyone will tell you that. And a child saw how widow Thébault, armed with a stick, chased rats in the cellar and drained them of blood.
$GEN_037_WIT_01_A_02
Did you see it with your own eyes?
$GEN_037_WIT_01_A_03
I didn’t. I work at the factory all day, building vehicles. It’s hard work. What if I don’t fix a part well and the vehicle collapses? My neighbours saw everything, though.
$GEN_037_WIT_01_B_QTitle
Had your wife been complaining about pain for a long time?
$GEN_037_WIT_01_B_00
Had your wife been complaining about pain for a long time?
$GEN_037_WIT_01_B_01
She did complain about headaches, I think for a month or two. She also had no appetite, but that’s nothing. I often have no appetite after a day of hard work myself.
$GEN_037_WIT_01_B_02
Would you say that, despite those issues, your wife was healthy?
$GEN_037_WIT_01_B_03
Healthy as a horse. A day before it all started, she tried to take me to a dance. My Abelone loved to dance, but I was always telling her, “Not today, let’s go next week. I can barely feel my legs.” I should’ve… I should’ve gone.
