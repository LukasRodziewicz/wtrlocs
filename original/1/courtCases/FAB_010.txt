The accused who will now stand before us is Jean-Nicolas Pache, the Mayor of Paris, suspected of treason through <a name="1" class="hidden">cooperation with hostile powers</a>.
$FAB_010_DOC_01_01
He was arrested following the written testimony of Béatrice Caron, daughter of a local cooper, but best known for her connections with the rotten Muscadins. The girl admitted to being an Austrian spy, and declared that she obtained information from the defendant himself. Thanks to her knowledge, she was allegedly able to disrupt the everyday lives of Parisians. In exchange for revealing her informant in the city authorities, Caron was expelled from France under the penalty of death should she return.
$FAB_010_DOC_01_02
The investigation, which I carried out together with Prosecutor Tinville, indicates that Citizen Pache was following the orders of Caron’s Austrian employers, and the girl was responsible for exchanging letters between the two. We were unable to find solid evidence for many of the mayor’s suspicious acts, but one aspect of the investigation is clear – the <a name="3" class="hidden">delayed construction</a> of the Pont de la Révolution. Enemy forces wished to prevent it, as the structure was to unite the French, to become a symbol of the rekindled Revolutionary flame. The plotters could also hope to <a name="5" class="hidden">bring shame upon Robespierre himself</a> as the originator and supporter of this undertaking.
$FAB_010_DOC_01_03
The evidence of this conspiracy was discovered in <a name="6" class="hidden">letters</a> that we confiscated during a search of the defendant’s office. All of them were signed only with a <a name="7" class="hidden">“D”</a>, and we have not been able to ascertain the identity of this mysterious person. We have rejected the most popular suggestion – that it is Danton – as it is common knowledge that he and Robespierre are political allies, as well as friends.

Letter
$FAB_010_DOC_02_00
	For J.-N. P.
	The gentlemen of the mason’s guild are not willing to listen to our arguments and have suspended their work on the bridge. They will have to be convinced by force. Do it, Pache – Robespierre will give in, and you will get your payment. 
	
	D.

I want to check the defendant’s personal details once again.
$FAB_010_OnStart_01
My name is Jean-Nicolas Pache, and I am the Mayor of Paris.
$FAB_010_OnStart_02
You have been accused of spying on behalf of Austria. Do you understand, Citizen Pache?
$FAB_010_OnStart_03
Yes, I understand everything.
$FAB_010_OnStart_04
You are not nervous. That is quite unusual for someone in your situation.
$FAB_010_OnStart_05
I am awaiting a just trial.
$FAB_010_OnGuilty_00
I am sentencing you to death. You will pay for my son!
$FAB_010_OnGuilty_01
Justice!
$FAB_010_OnGuilty_02
That’s what happens to traitors!
$FAB_010_OnGuilty_03
I have kept my part of the deal! Now keep yours, and show me you are a man of honour!
$FAB_010_OnPrison_00
[To jest mock i należy go zmienić!!!!]
$FAB_010_OnNotGuilty_00
The defendant is innocent. Take him out of my sight.
$FAB_010_OnNotGuilty_01
This is a scandal!
$FAB_010_OnNotGuilty_02
The judge is protecting his own people!
$FAB_010_01x02_00_QTitle
Do you admit to having cooperated with a foreign power?
$FAB_010_01x02_00_00
Do you admit to having cooperated with a foreign power?
$FAB_010_01x02_00_01
Yes, I do.
$FAB_010_01x02_00_02
That was surprisingly quick and straightforward.
$FAB_010_01x02_00_03
He’s a brave one. What, does he think he’ll escape the guillotine for his courage?
$FAB_010_01x02_00_04
What did you receive in exchange for spying?
$FAB_010_01x02_00_05
Most of the time money, but sometimes we exchanged information. I was able to gain valuable knowledge regarding my opponents.
$FAB_010_01x02_00_06
What kind of nonsense is this?
$FAB_010_01x02_00_07
I am fully cooperating with the court.
$FAB_010_01x05_01_QTitle
Did our enemies wish to discredit Robespierre?
$FAB_010_01x05_01_00
Did our enemies wish to discredit Robespierre?
$FAB_010_01x05_01_01
As far as I know, yes. He was a thorn in their side, effectively blocking their activity. They tried to bribe him many times…
$FAB_010_01x05_01_02
Such adulation.
$FAB_010_01x05_01_03
It comes from the Austrians rather than me.
$FAB_010_01x05_01_04
He’s a modest man, for a traitor.
$FAB_010_01x05_01_05
After the failed bribery attempts, the decision was made to take more brutal steps. I was supposed to help with this.
$FAB_010_01x05_01_06
What steps were those?
$FAB_010_01x05_01_07
I do not know. I was arrested before I had the chance to find out.
$FAB_010_03x04_02_QTitle
Do you realise how much harm you did to the Revolution…
$FAB_010_03x04_02_00
Do you realise how much harm you did to the Revolution due to the complications around the bridge’s construction?
$FAB_010_03x04_02_01
Yes, such was the intention of my secret employers.
$FAB_010_03x04_02_02
The bridge was supposed to connect the two shores of the Seine, where two areas inhabited by vastly different people were to meet half way–
$FAB_010_03x04_02_03
Please spare me the propaganda, I know it by heart.
$FAB_010_03x04_02_04
Shut your mouth and listen to your betters!
$FAB_010_03x04_02_05
You do not appear to regret your actions.
$FAB_010_03x04_02_06
Because I am not flagellating myself in public? I do regret it, and what I am doing here now should be sufficient proof of that.
$FAB_010_03x04_02_07
But you want to silence me, the prosecutor chosen by the people!
$FAB_010_03x04_02_08
It has always been about dividing the French. It worked before, and still continues to do so.
$FAB_010_06x03_03_QTitle
Did you follow the orders of your employers and hinder the progress of construction workers…?
$FAB_010_06x03_03_00
Did you follow the orders of your employers and hinder the progress of construction workers hired at the Pont de la Révolution?
$FAB_010_06x03_03_01
Yes, I did my best to make sure that employees from every office involved would conduct strict inspections of all aspects of the construction–
$FAB_010_06x03_03_02
And the bridge is still unfinished, after all these years!
$FAB_010_06x03_03_03
A pig and a traitor!
$FAB_010_06x03_03_04
I was able to interfere effectively. However, I was unfortunately not able to keep it a secret.
$FAB_010_07x06_04_QTitle
Did you receive all your orders through letters?
$FAB_010_07x06_04_00
Did you receive all your orders through letters?
$FAB_010_07x06_04_01
Yes. And why do you ask, monsieur le juge?
$FAB_010_07x06_04_02
I wonder if you ever saw the people paying you?
$FAB_010_07x06_04_03
No, we never met.
$FAB_010_07x06_04_04
So they may not have been Austrians, after all.
$FAB_010_07x06_04_05
What are you suggesting?
$FAB_010_07x06_04_06
Rumour suggests that the mysterious “D” could be Danton, attempting to weaken Robespierre and France.
$FAB_010_07x06_04_07
That is nonsense. Everybody knows that Danton and Robespierre are political allies.
$FAB_010_07x06_04_08
I have to agree with monsieur le juge, and besides–
$FAB_010_07x06_04_09
You are probably familiar with the idea that Danton could be an English spy. Perhaps it is not the Austrians who are behind this after all, and Citizen Pache has instead been fooled into becoming a scapegoat?
$FAB_010_07x06_04_10
Pure speculation! As a person who knows both of these Citizens very well, I can assure you such suggestions are unfounded.
$FAB_010_05x07_05_QTitle
Were any other Citizens of France involved in the plan to compromise Robespierre?
$FAB_010_05x07_05_00
Were any other Citizens of France involved in the plan to compromise Robespierre?
$FAB_010_05x07_05_01
I do not know. Nobody informed me of such details…
$FAB_010_05x07_05_02
But you must have heard something.
$FAB_010_05x07_05_03
I was taking money for treason, not to eavesdrop on my employers. Although, knowing them, there was almost certainly an alternative plan that involves a prominent Citizen.
$FAB_010_05x07_05_04

$FAB_010_UNIQUE_QUESTION_00
With whom would the defendant share confidential information?
$FAB_010_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_00_00
With Béatrice Caron.
$FAB_010_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_00_00
With Danton.
$FAB_010_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_00_01
With his wife.
$FAB_010_UNIQUE_QUESTION_01
Did the defendant reveal the identity of the person calling themselves “D”?
$FAB_010_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_01_00
He did not. Nor did he confirm our suspicions.
$FAB_010_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_00
It is Danton.
$FAB_010_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_01
It is Demay, a baker.
$FAB_010_PLOT_TWIST_GUARD_01_01
Citizen Fidèle, you have to… There is something you need to see.
$FAB_010_PLOT_TWIST_JUDGE_01_02
You scumbag! My child!
$FAB_010_PLOT_TWIST_MENTOR_01_02
Alexis, try to calm yourself.
$FAB_010_PLOT_TWIST_TINVILLE_01_03
Citizen Fidèle… We heard about your tragedy. Is there anything we–
$FAB_010_PLOT_TWIST_JUDGE_01_04
All of you, shut the hell up! Pache, why did you kill my boy?!
$FAB_010_PLOT_TWIST_PASHE_01_05
Your Honour, I did not kill anyone!
$FAB_010_PLOT_TWIST_JUDGE_02_QTitle
Why did you do it, Pache?
$FAB_010_PLOT_TWIST_JUDGE_02_01
Why did you do it, Pache?
$FAB_010_PLOT_TWIST_PASHE_02_02
What am I even being accused of now?
$FAB_010_PLOT_TWIST_JUDGE_02_03
Of killing my child!
$FAB_010_PLOT_TWIST_PASHE_02_04
I was in a cell all this time. And we… we had a deal. I would not make any move against you, I swear!
$FAB_010_PLOT_TWIST_TINVILLE_02_05
Still so docile, even when there is a dead child in the equation!
$FAB_010_PLOT_TWIST_JUDGE_03_QTitle
Who killed my son, Pache?
$FAB_010_PLOT_TWIST_JUDGE_03_01
Who killed my son, Pache?
$FAB_010_PLOT_TWIST_PASHE_03_02
I have no idea who could do something like this! I never-
$FAB_010_PLOT_TWIST_JUDGE_03_03
Who is behind this? Tell me immediately, or you will go straight to the scaffold!
$FAB_010_PLOT_TWIST_PASHE_03_04
See? The Judge is threatening me with the guillotine for his own gain. This is not a trial, this is a farce!
$FAB_010_PLOT_TWIST_TINVILLE_03_05
Quiet, child-killer!
