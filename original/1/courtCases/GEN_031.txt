Arthur Bonnet, 38-year-old director of the Odéon-Théâtre, has been accused of pandering. The law enforcement authorities have known about the brothel for a long time. Some of the actresses sell their bodies right after the play, using the acting as a pretext, but also to advertise themselves. Among the Odéon’s clientele are members of the National Convention and officers. Thanks to them, director Bonnet is able to derive <a name="2" class="hidden">significant financial reward</a> without fear of any consequences. The latest reports, however, seem too outrageous to be ignored. 
$GEN_031_DOC_1_01
Bonnet has been <a name="3" class="hidden">accused of pandering</a> 13-year-old Olivia de Nerval, who was left in his care. The court administration learned about this from Arnaud de Condorcet, a friend of the recently-guillotined father of the girl.
$GEN_031_DOC_1_02
Arnaud testified that Olivia de Nerval played a role in <a name="5" class="hidden">a private show</a> titled “The Misfortunes of Virtue”, shown only to a small number of carefully selected guests. Usually after such private shows some of the actresses have <a name="6" class="hidden">“private meetings”</a> with their admirers. Arnaud witnessed that Bonnet ordered one of his subordinates, Maria Deraismes, to <a name="7" class="hidden">walk Olivia</a> to a room where Gustave Clavel, a theatre critic known for his lechery, was already waiting.
$GEN_031_DOC_1_03
De Condorcet’s accusations quickly spread among the aristocrats, who demanded the immediate arrest and severe punishment of Bonnet. Meanwhile, <a name="8" class="hidden">Olivia</a> refused to testify and Clavel has disappeared.

$GEN_031_OnStart_00
Citizen, what is your name?
$GEN_031_OnStart_01
Arthur Bonnet, monsieur le juge.
$GEN_031_OnStart_02
You are accused of pandering your minor ward, Olivia de Nerval, for your own financial gain. How do you plead to these charges?
$GEN_031_OnStart_03
I did nothing of the sort! Who dares say so?
$GEN_031_OnStart_04
Citizen Arnaud de Condorcet, present in the courtroom, claims that you did.
$GEN_031_OnStart_05
That is slander, a plot against me conjured up by this man! I am the director of a most famous theatre known throughout Paris, not a… souteneur!
$GEN_031_OnStart_06
The price list found during the investigation points to the contrary.
$GEN_031_OnStart_07
You are jumping to conclusions.
$GEN_031_OnStart_08
They will take him away and behead him any minute, that loathsome pimp.
$GEN_031_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Citizen Arthur Bonnet to be guillotined! Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_031_OnGuilty_01
Disgusting monster. I’m glad it’s over.
$GEN_031_OnGuilty_02
At least there will be something to watch.
$GEN_031_OnGuilty_03
He deserved it.
$GEN_031_OnNotGuilty_00
The judgement for Arthur Bonnet is… not guilty! Take the defendant away.
$GEN_031_OnNotGuilty_01
Not guilty? How is that possible?!
$GEN_031_OnNotGuilty_02
Come on, he runs a brothel!
$GEN_031_OnNotGuilty_03
The judge must like his actresses!
$GEN_031_OnNotGuilty_04
Even if you do not believe what has been said about Olivia, you can see that the theatre is little more than a brothel.
$GEN_031_08x03_00_QTitle
Why did de Nerval come under your custody after her father’s death?
$GEN_031_08x03_00_00
Why did de Nerval come under your custody after her father’s death?
$GEN_031_08x03_00_01
It is very simple. She was first put into an orphanage, and I adopted her once I recognised her talent.
$GEN_031_08x03_00_02
What talent?
$GEN_031_08x03_00_03
Well… acting, of course.
$GEN_031_08x03_00_04
Children were giving performances in the orphanage?
$GEN_031_08x03_00_05
No, but I can recognise talent by watching how a child walks and holds their head, by listening to their voice and their choice of words.
$GEN_031_08x03_00_06
How a child “walks”, right?
$GEN_031_08x03_00_07
How often do you look for future actresses in orphanages?
$GEN_031_08x03_00_08
Not as often as I should. There is too little time for it, which is a shame, because you can find true stars among the orphans.
$GEN_031_01x06_01_QTitle
Do the meetings of the actresses with their audience conclude in bed?
$GEN_031_01x06_01_00
Do the meetings of the actresses with their audience conclude in bed?
$GEN_031_01x06_01_01
They are private meetings. I have no idea what happens during them.
$GEN_031_01x06_01_02
Can we assume that during those private meetings the visitor and the visited engage in sexual activities?
$GEN_031_01x06_01_03
Allow me to repeat myself – I have never been present at such a meeting. I have heard gossip, of course, but I think that stems from the strong imagination of our clients.
$GEN_031_01x06_01_04
All of them?
$GEN_031_01x06_01_05
Our actresses are so adored for their incredible talents that I believe every man dreams about them, but they are only dreams.
$GEN_031_01x06_01_06
Are you saying that those men pay hundreds of francs for only a conversation?
$GEN_031_01x06_01_07
Some people pay for good wine, others for interesting conversation. It is none of my business.
$GEN_031_01x06_01_08
Hasn’t seen anything, doesn’t know anything. Right…
$GEN_031_01x09_02_QTitle
You charge your customers for meetings with the actresses. What exactly are they paying for?
$GEN_031_01x09_02_00
You charge your customers for meetings with the actresses. What exactly are they paying for?
$GEN_031_01x09_02_01
For a conversation, for a private show. Sometimes our ladies read poetry or sing. Such performances are extremely important for us, as the theatre is very expensive to maintain.
$GEN_031_01x09_02_02
What an interesting way of improving the budget. Could you describe the rooms in which those meetings take place?
$GEN_031_01x09_02_03
Our stars have dedicated rooms where they can rest and prepare for the show.
$GEN_031_01x09_02_04
Are those rooms furnished with beds?
$GEN_031_01x09_02_05
Of course they are. After two hours of performing and dancing, they would be rather tired, don't you think?
$GEN_031_01x09_02_06
How many clients visit your “stars” in a single night?
$GEN_031_01x09_02_07
One or two. In very special cases three, but I would rather not exhaust the actresses.
$GEN_031_01x09_02_08
You think conversations are exhausting?
$GEN_031_01x09_02_09
Their mouths must burn like hell, but not from talking.
$GEN_031_01x09_02_10
Behave, will you?
$GEN_031_01x09_02_11
They really are sensitive and should be treated with respect.
$GEN_031_05x06_03_QTitle
Do those private meetings take place after…?
$GEN_031_05x06_03_00
Do those private meetings take place after the private shows?
$GEN_031_05x06_03_01
Not exclusively, but most of them do happen after such performances.
$GEN_031_05x06_03_02
Did Olivia de Nerval take part in such a meeting?
$GEN_031_05x06_03_03
If that’s what Arnaud told you, he’s lying! I would never let a 13-year-old meet with her fans! Not at this stage of her life and career!
$GEN_031_05x06_03_04
Why not? Wouldn’t she just be having a conversation?
$GEN_031_05x06_03_05
Conversations can be exhausting, and she is just a child.
$GEN_031_05x06_03_06
Why would de Condorcet lie?
$GEN_031_05x06_03_07
He has been trying to take over the position of the Odéon-Théâtre’s director. He even threatened to do whatever he could to destroy me! So he came up with this… “pandering”.
$GEN_031_03x07_04_QTitle
Call in the witness, Maria Deraismes.
$GEN_031_03x07_04_00
Call in the witness, Maria Deraismes.
$GEN_031_03x07_04_02
Witness, what is your name?
$GEN_031_03x07_04_03
I’m Maria Deraismes.
$GEN_031_03x07_04_04
What position do you have in the Odéon-Théâtre?
$GEN_031_03x07_04_05
I’m a burmaiden. I manage the female personnel of the theatre.
$GEN_031_02x09_05_QTitle
How much of the revenue obtained through those private meetings lands in the theatre’s coffers?
$GEN_031_02x09_05_00
How much of the revenue obtained through those private meetings lands in the theatre’s coffers?
$GEN_031_02x09_05_01
According to the agreement with the staff, 70 percent. That’s a lot, I know, but maintaining the rooms, food, and sometimes drink too… They all generate costs. Besides, if it weren’t for the theatre’s reputation… you know.
$GEN_031_02x09_05_02
Do you receive a bonus for those meetings?
$GEN_031_02x09_05_03
Because of my ideas the theatre’s profits are greater than ever. Am I rewarded for this? Of course, and it’s only fair.
$GEN_031_02x09_05_04
So it is important to you to arrange as many of those meetings as possible?
$GEN_031_02x09_05_05
Yes, because it’s in the theatre’s best interest.
$GEN_031_02x09_05_06
It is in your best interest too.
$GEN_031_02x09_05_07
Yes, but that’s not important to me.
$GEN_031_04x05_06_QTitle
Do you confirm that your ward was acting in…?
$GEN_031_04x05_06_00
Do you confirm that your ward was acting in the private show “The Misfortunes of Virtue”, performed to a very limited audience?
$GEN_031_04x05_06_01
Of course. Where else could she learn acting, if not on stage?
$GEN_031_04x05_06_02
Was she also supposed to learn during her meeting with Clavel?
$GEN_031_04x05_06_03
I bet she also gave a performance, just something different from the play.
$GEN_031_04x05_06_04
I would hope so. That man is incredibly well-versed when it comes to theatre. His remarks must have been invaluable.
$GEN_031_05x08_07_QTitle
What role did Olivia de Nerval play in “The Misfortunes of Virtue”?
$GEN_031_05x08_07_00
What role did Olivia de Nerval play in “The Misfortunes of Virtue”?
$GEN_031_05x08_07_01
Oh, a minor one. A bit part, really. She played one of the countrywomen harassed by a depraved marquis.
$GEN_031_05x08_07_02
If it was a bit part, the theatre should charge Clavel 200 francs according to the brochure. Did you?
$GEN_031_05x08_07_03
It was actually a background one, so we would charge 50. However, since Citizen Clavel met with Olivia to teach her, I decided to waive the payment. It was, after all, for Olivia’s own benefit.
$GEN_031_05x08_07_04
I’m sure it was for Clavel’s benefit too!
$GEN_031_05x08_07_05
Are you planning on charging people for meeting Olivia in the future?
$GEN_031_05x08_07_06
I… I mean… Yes, why not? If she decides to stay in the theatre, of course, and I hope that she will.
$GEN_031_05x08_07_07
And you will financially benefit from that?
$GEN_031_05x08_07_08
Well, yes, I would.
$GEN_031_WIT_00_A_QTitle
Who arranged Olivia de Nerval’s meeting with Gustave Clavel?
$GEN_031_WIT_00_A_00
Who arranged Olivia de Nerval’s meeting with Gustave Clavel?
$GEN_031_WIT_00_A_01
It wasn’t an arranged meeting. Mr Clavel was impressed by her performance and asked for the opportunity to talk to her.
$GEN_031_WIT_00_A_02
I assume that the meeting actually took place. Were they alone?
$GEN_031_WIT_00_A_03
Naturally. The director allowed it, so I found an empty room for them.
$GEN_031_WIT_00_A_04
So the accused knew about everything and gave his personal permission?
$GEN_031_WIT_00_A_05
Monsieur le juge, nothing in the Odéon-Théâtre happens without the director’s knowledge and permission.
$GEN_031_WIT_00_A_06
So he did know what was happening behind closed doors.
$GEN_031_WIT_00_B_QTitle
How much was Clavel charged for his meeting with de Nerval?
$GEN_031_WIT_00_B_00
How much was Clavel charged for his meeting with de Nerval?
$GEN_031_WIT_00_B_01
Nothing. Conversations like that aren’t included in the price list. It was just a meeting of a theatrical critic with an actress in training.
$GEN_031_WIT_01_A_QTitle
Apart from Gustave Clavel, did anyone else have a meeting with the accused’s ward?
$GEN_031_WIT_01_A_00
Apart from Gustave Clavel, did anyone else have a meeting with the accused’s ward?
$GEN_031_WIT_01_A_01
No, although Mr Arnaud de Condorcet asked for such a chance before the performance and even wanted to pay for it.
$GEN_031_WIT_01_A_02
How interesting. Did the director give his permission?
$GEN_031_WIT_01_A_03
No, he flatly refused. He said that Olivia is not a professional actress yet, and that she’s too young to meet her admirers anyway.
$GEN_031_WIT_01_A_04
What was de Condorcet’s reaction?
$GEN_031_WIT_01_A_05
He was very agitated, vulgar even. I can’t blame him. Olivia is a very… talented apprentice.
$GEN_031_WIT_01_B_QTitle
Has Gustave Clavel met with other actresses in the past?
$GEN_031_WIT_01_B_00
Has Gustave Clavel met with other actresses in the past?
$GEN_031_WIT_01_B_01
Of course. He’s a recognised literary critic, after all, and likes our… I mean acknowledges the talents of our actresses.
$GEN_031_WIT_01_B_02
Are you suggesting that he is an enthusiast of paid love?
$GEN_031_WIT_01_B_03
I never said anything of the sort.
$GEN_031_WIT_01_B_04
What was the duration of those meetings?
$GEN_031_WIT_01_B_05
From several minutes to half an hour.
$GEN_031_WIT_01_B_06
What about his meeting with Olivia de Nerval?
$GEN_031_WIT_01_B_07
Several minutes. I can assure you that they were only talking.
$GEN_031_WIT_01_B_08
Did you witness the conversation?
$GEN_031_WIT_01_B_09
No, but I was doing things in the corridor. If anything… happened, I’d have noticed.
