Jean Ibert, the <a name="1" class="hidden">famous</a> street urchin who killed the governor of the Bastille, de Launay, and carried his head on a pike, has recently been detained. After the triumph of the Revolution, he reached the nadir of his life. Though many people still consider him a hero, they do not care that the Parisian archives are filled with <a name="2" class="hidden">complaints</a> about thefts, robberies, and assaults on women.
$GEN_022_DOC_1_01
The current case is much graver, as Ibert is accused of <a name="3" class="hidden">raping</a> 16-year-old <a name="4" class="hidden">Élodie de Pontalba</a>. The charges were brought by the victim’s father, Baron Thomas de Pontalba. It is widely known that de Pontalba was a <a name="5" class="hidden">relative</a> and friend of Governor de Launay.
$GEN_022_DOC_1_02
The crime allegedly took place in the tenement belonging to the victim’s family. Jean was detained by people working outside while trying to escape the building. Élodie gave a written statement saying that the incident took place on a holiday, and Jean used the absence of the Baron and most of the servants to <a name="7" class="hidden">break into</a> to the tenement. Once he was inside, he entered her room and raped her.
$GEN_022_DOC_1_03
The incident was witnessed by Anne Michel, Élodie's governess. It was she who alarmed the workers about disturbing noises coming from her charge's room. A number of witnesses felt obliged to inform us that Anne Michel is known for her psychotic jealousy and her numerous romances with the people of France.

Anne Michel’s testimony:

	Usually in the mornings Miss Élodie and I read. However, the chef had that day off, so I was preparing tea. Then I heard her screaming! I ran to her room, but stopped when I heard a male voice. I was scared and asked for help.

$GEN_022_OnStart_00
They’re bringing in Jean!
$GEN_022_OnStart_01
We’re with you, Jean!
$GEN_022_OnStart_02
Please introduce yourself.
$GEN_022_OnStart_03
Jean Ibert, the conqueror of the Bastille and vanquisher of the tyrant de Launay! The hero of all Parisians!
$GEN_022_OnStart_04
Jean Ibert, you are accused of raping Miss Élodie de Pontalba, daughter of Baron Thomas de Pontalba. Do you plead guilty?
$GEN_022_OnStart_05
I don’t plead anything. That bourgeois and her Counter-Revolutionary father are filthy liars.
$GEN_022_OnStart_06
We need to bear in mind the possibility of criminal collusion in the charges.
$GEN_022_OnStart_07
That’s right. Those rich swines love their machinations.
$GEN_022_OnStart_08
The evidence speaks against you.
$GEN_022_OnStart_09
Girlish duplicity and de Pontalba’s plots prove nothing!
$GEN_022_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Citizen Jean Ibert to be guillotined! Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_022_OnGuilty_01
The evidence against him was not conclusive.
$GEN_022_OnGuilty_02
Outrageous!
$GEN_022_OnGuilty_03
What are you doing, you fool?
$GEN_022_OnGuilty_04
Traitor of the people, murderer of our hero!
$GEN_022_OnPrison_00
Citizen Jean Ibert will go to jail. Take him away!
$GEN_022_OnPrison_01
Is that all?
$GEN_022_OnPrison_02
The rapist should pay with his head!
$GEN_022_OnPrison_03
Or more than just his head!
$GEN_022_OnNotGuilty_00
The judgement for Jean Ibert is… not guilty! Take the defendant away.
$GEN_022_OnNotGuilty_01
I must admit that his guilt was not clearly confirmed.
$GEN_022_OnNotGuilty_02
Bravo!
$GEN_022_OnNotGuilty_03
This is the France we fought for when storming the Bastille!
$GEN_022_OnNotGuilty_04
The Judge is one of us!
$GEN_022_04x06_00_QTitle
Did you know Miss Élodie de Pontalba before the incident?
$GEN_022_04x06_00_00
Did you know Miss Élodie de Pontalba before the incident?
$GEN_022_04x06_00_01
She flirted with me every time she visited the Café Procope, and she came to every dispute between Danton and Marat. I finally gave that girl what she was asking for.
$GEN_022_04x06_00_02
So you admit to your guilt?
$GEN_022_04x06_00_03
Yes, but it wasn’t rape. Show me one girl that would say no to a hero.
$GEN_022_04x06_00_04
You say you met her at the Café Procope? I highly doubt that such a young lady would go to a place like that all by herself.
$GEN_022_04x06_00_05
Who said she was alone? Anne brought her, and everyone knows she likes to have fun.
$GEN_022_04x06_00_06
Are you talking about Anne Michel, Miss Élodie’s governess?
$GEN_022_04x06_00_07
That’s right.
$GEN_022_04x06_00_08
So that was not the first time you entered the house of the victim’s family?
$GEN_022_04x06_00_09
What victim? Anyway, yes, I was there a few times and I know it well. Let me just say that Anne Michel and I have explored every–
$GEN_022_04x06_00_10
Spare us the details…
$GEN_022_04x06_00_11
The old whore took the young whore for a walk!
$GEN_022_01x05_01_QTitle
Did you know that Baron de Pontalba is a relative of…?
$GEN_022_01x05_01_00
Did you know that Baron de Pontalba is a relative of the deceased Governor de Launay?
$GEN_022_01x05_01_01
No, but that explains a lot. The whole case was conjured up by de Pontalba. He wants to get rid of me because I freed France from a tyrant!
$GEN_022_01x05_01_02
De Launay’s family should have been executed a long time ago.
$GEN_022_01x05_01_03
So you would not call rape an instrument in the war against the Monarchists?
$GEN_022_01x05_01_04
Monarchists should be decapitated! And their daughters should be… thanking the heroes of the Revolution.
$GEN_022_01x05_01_05
That’s right!
$GEN_022_01x05_01_06
Silence! We are talking about a young girl who was raped!
$GEN_022_03x06_02_QTitle
How did you break into the tenement belonging to Baron de Pontalba?
$GEN_022_03x06_02_00
How did you break into the tenement belonging to Baron de Pontalba?
$GEN_022_03x06_02_01
Why would I break in? I used the back door.
$GEN_022_03x06_02_02
How did you know about that entrance?
$GEN_022_03x06_02_03
The Baron’s daughter told me. She also informed me that her beloved father and most of the servants wouldn’t be at home.
$GEN_022_03x06_02_04
She told you to visit her for that specific purpose?
$GEN_022_03x06_02_05
She was giving very clear signs.
$GEN_022_03x06_02_06
All aristocrats are whores.
$GEN_022_03x06_02_07
Are you saying that you came to Baron de Pontalba’s house at the invitation of the victim?
$GEN_022_03x06_02_08
That young bitch promised me a nice afternoon. She explained everything in detail.
$GEN_022_03x06_02_09
Let Jean go!
$GEN_022_03x06_02_10
Quiet, people, the Judge is beginning to understand. Remain calm and he will soon let me go.
$GEN_022_02x08_03_QTitle
Do you find a particular pleasure in the abuse of women?
$GEN_022_02x08_03_00
Do you find a particular pleasure in the abuse of women?
$GEN_022_02x08_03_01
Why would I abuse women when there are nicer things to do with them? Well, unless they like it.
$GEN_022_02x08_03_02
Are you suggesting that the victim wanted to get raped and beaten?
$GEN_022_02x08_03_03
I didn’t force her to do anything, and I definitely didn’t beat her.
$GEN_022_02x08_03_04
The medical examination proves clearly that she was injured.
$GEN_022_02x08_03_05
Better ask de Pontalba who battered her. He was furious when he found out who was in bed with his sweet daughter.
$GEN_022_02x08_03_06
Are you suggesting that he assaulted his daughter because she consorted with you?
$GEN_022_02x08_03_07
It wouldn’t surprise me.
$GEN_022_02x08_03_08
Aristocrats do worse things than beating their own children.
$GEN_022_03x08_04_QTitle
Call in Anne Michel as a witness.
$GEN_022_03x08_04_00
Call in Anne Michel as a witness.
$GEN_022_03x08_04_02
Citizen, what is your name?
$GEN_022_03x08_04_03
Anne Michel, Miss Élodie de Pontalba’s governess.
$GEN_022_02x03_05_QTitle
How many of your previous victims have you raped?
$GEN_022_02x03_05_00
How many of your previous victims have you raped?
$GEN_022_02x03_05_01
None. I’ve done many things, but luckily I’m still young and handsome enough to not need violence to be with a woman.
$GEN_022_02x03_05_02
Then what were all those women accusing you of?
$GEN_022_02x03_05_03
I’ve no idea. They didn’t complain when we were together.
$GEN_022_02x03_05_04
Were you ever sentenced for assaulting a woman?
$GEN_022_02x03_05_05
They never proved my guilt.
$GEN_022_02x03_05_06
And they’ll let him go this time too.
$GEN_022_02x03_05_07
Then why were they making those accusations?
$GEN_022_02x03_05_08
They probably just wanted money.
$GEN_022_04x05_06_QTitle
Did you choose Élodie de Pontalba for your victim because she is related to de Launay?
$GEN_022_04x05_06_00
Did you choose Miss de Pontalba for your victim because she is related to de Launay?
$GEN_022_04x05_06_01
I didn’t know they were related.
$GEN_022_04x05_06_02
Then why her?
$GEN_022_04x05_06_03
She was young, soft skinned, and very eager, if you really want to know.
$GEN_022_04x05_06_04
Are you suggesting that it was Miss de Pontalba who initiated the intercourse?
$GEN_022_04x05_06_05
Who did what? Ah, did she ask for me to caress her? Oh, she desperately wanted that. She dreamed about me for a long time.
$GEN_022_03x04_07_QTitle
The victim is but a frail girl, did you really have to beat her that badly?
$GEN_022_03x04_07_00
The victim is but a frail girl, did you really have to beat her that badly?
$GEN_022_03x04_07_01
Why would I beat her? I didn’t even have to undress her.
$GEN_022_03x04_07_02
She removed her clothes by herself?
$GEN_022_03x04_07_03
She jumped out of her dress, unfastened my belt, and–
$GEN_022_03x04_07_04
We don’t need to hear the details.
$GEN_022_03x04_07_05
Monsieur le juge, I can tell you everything in great detail if you want me to.
$GEN_022_03x04_07_06
Did she take her clothes off because you threatened her?
$GEN_022_03x04_07_07
She would have threatened me if I had refused her!
$GEN_022_03x04_07_08
Go on, we’re listening!
$GEN_022_03x04_07_09
Silence! If you want gossip, go to the market.
$GEN_022_WIT_00_A_QTitle
What do you know about the case?
$GEN_022_WIT_00_A_00
What do you know about the case?
$GEN_022_WIT_00_A_01
Ibert is guilty and should be killed. He used our relationship to get closer to the Baron’s daughter and hurt her.
$GEN_022_WIT_00_A_02
What do you mean?
$GEN_022_WIT_00_A_03
He knew exactly when the servants had a day off and when the Baron left for the Legislative Assembly.
$GEN_022_WIT_00_A_04
Did he learn those facts from you?
$GEN_022_WIT_00_A_05
Not directly. He paid me several visits at Baron de Pontalba’s house.
$GEN_022_WIT_00_A_06
Did it not occur to you that he may use this knowledge against the Baron’s family?
$GEN_022_WIT_00_A_07
…
$GEN_022_WIT_00_A_08
I see. Did the Baron know about your meetings?
$GEN_022_WIT_00_A_09
No, the Baron had more important things to worry about than the personal lives of his servants.
$GEN_022_WIT_01_A_QTitle
Why did you neglect your duties and stop looking after the victim?
$GEN_022_WIT_01_A_00
Why did you neglect your duties and stop looking after the victim?
$GEN_022_WIT_01_A_01
That day, the Baron ordered me to take care of the house. Miss Élodie didn’t have any classes and was spending time in her room.
$GEN_022_WIT_01_A_02
And you did not hear the accused entering the building?
$GEN_022_WIT_01_A_03
No, I was busy in the kitchen. I wasn’t alerted until I heard sounds of a struggle and Miss Élodie’s screams coming from her room.
$GEN_022_WIT_01_A_04
I find it baffling that you did not hear anything before then.
$GEN_022_WIT_01_A_05
I can’t explain that, but I was making a lot of noise while cooking.
$GEN_022_WIT_01_A_06
Is watching the house not one of your responsibilities?
$GEN_022_WIT_01_A_07
Well, yes, but I can’t be in two places at once…
