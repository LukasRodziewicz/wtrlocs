Late in the evening, in one of the dark alleys near the Panthéon, a National Guard patrol stopped <a name="1" class="hidden">a fight</a> between two elegant men. When the soldiers approached the attackers, they saw that one of them, elderly and grey-bearded, was standing over his fallen opponent, shouting angrily and kicking him.
$GEN_039_DOC_1_01
Three strong soldiers were involved in detaining the brawlers, and they were forced to use their rifle butts. The two <a name="3" class="hidden">ragged and bleeding</a> men were taken to the nearest station where the officer there judged, by their breath, that neither of them had been drinking wine on that evening.
$GEN_039_DOC_1_02
The aggressor was immediately interrogated, but he would only babble incomprehensibly. The lieutenant was able to note down only two words: <a name="5" class="hidden">"dictionary"</a> and "plagiarism". When later asked to repeat his statement, the grey-bearded man said that he was <a name="6" class="hidden">robbed</a>. The beaten man's name is Léonard Pomeroy. He is alive, but he will not be able to talk to people for some time due to a broken jaw.

Please introduce yourself.
$GEN_039_OnStart_01
Professor Hugo Trottier, former lecturer at the now closed Sorbonne, a true university from before the Revolution.
$GEN_039_OnStart_02
Please explain why you assaulted that man.
$GEN_039_OnStart_03
We are both lexicographers. However, I have been working on my text for over 15 years, while he is a bungler, which is a word for “someone who makes mistakes due to their incompetence”.
$GEN_039_OnStart_04
What does that have to do with the assault?
$GEN_039_OnStart_05
This victim, as you call him, is an ignoramus, and a thief! He copied dozens of entries from my dictionary and then bluntly denied doing so in front of witnesses.
$GEN_039_OnStart_06
Why did you not report this to the Guard?
$GEN_039_OnStart_07
I paid them a visit, but they showed nothing but complete disregard, which is a word for–
$GEN_039_OnStart_08
We know what “disregard” means.
$GEN_039_OnGuilty_00
Regardless of the reasons, you committed an unacceptable crime, and you are sentenced to be guillotined.
$GEN_039_OnGuilty_01
How brave! Though I understand you, we should not be lenient with these kinds of people.
$GEN_039_OnGuilty_02
The guillotine for a brawl? These are troubled times!
$GEN_039_OnPrison_00
For the assault on Citizen Pomeroy I sentence you to prison. Guards, lead the condemned out.
$GEN_039_OnPrison_01
Justice prevails.
$GEN_039_OnPrison_02
Serves him right, that fat Sorbonne wobble-bottom!
$GEN_039_OnNotGuilty_00
The defendant acted on impulse. The verdict is… not guilty.
$GEN_039_OnNotGuilty_01
What if tomorrow he kills someone on impulse? Who will be responsible for that death?
$GEN_039_OnNotGuilty_02
Surely this is a mistake! Does the Judge know what he’s doing?
$GEN_039_02x05_00_QTitle
You are both men of science. How can cultured people behave in such a way?

$GEN_039_02x05_00_01
Monsieur le juge, do you know the term “crime passionnel”? It means “to commit a crime under a sudden strong impulse while being in a state of high agitation”. When a crime is committed in this state, one feels a sudden and unbearable aggression.
$GEN_039_02x05_00_02
And what caused your crime passionnel?
$GEN_039_02x05_00_03
Plagiarism – “the act of wrongful appropriation of a person’s work and its publication under one’s own name.” Plagiarism should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law!
$GEN_039_02x05_00_04
Perhaps, but we are currently prosecuting the assault that you committed.
$GEN_039_02x05_00_05
And I admit it.
$GEN_039_02x05_00_06
Did you hear that? He publicly battered a man and admits to it!
$GEN_039_01x04_01_QTitle
Were you drinking alcohol on the day of the assault?
$GEN_039_01x04_01_00
Were you drinking alcohol on the day of the assault?
$GEN_039_01x04_01_01
Of course not, I rarely drink.
$GEN_039_01x04_01_02
So it was not a brawl caused by inebriation?
$GEN_039_01x04_01_03
We met by accident. I demanded that Pomeroy buy a column in a newspaper and admit to plagiarising my dictionary!
$GEN_039_01x04_01_04
And I assume Citizen Pomeroy did not agree to that?
$GEN_039_01x04_01_05
Of course not, he is a petty person, a Revolutionary barker. People like that never admit to their mistakes.
$GEN_039_01x04_01_06
“Revolutionary barker”? Was that meant to insult the Revolutionaries?
$GEN_039_01x04_01_07
Not all of them, only the thieves!
$GEN_039_01x04_01_08
Lower your voice.
$GEN_039_01x04_01_09
So you find that adjective to be insulting? I think we know everything we need to about your political views.
$GEN_039_03x02_02_QTitle
The investigator mentioned in the report that both of you had blood on your clothes…
$GEN_039_03x02_02_00
The investigator mentioned in the report that both of you had blood on your clothes, but at the moment of your arrest, Citizen Pomeroy was not trying to defend himself.
$GEN_039_03x02_02_01
It was a brawl, which means “a fist fight between at least two people who are both attacker and victim.”
$GEN_039_03x02_02_02
Are you implying that you were hurt too?
$GEN_039_03x02_02_03
Of course, but I knocked down Pomeroy, the walking failure that he is, before he was able to do the same to me.
$GEN_039_03x02_02_04
So it was you who accosted him on the street?
$GEN_039_03x02_02_05
Exactly. I demanded his apology.
$GEN_039_03x02_02_06
And when he refused, you punched him?
$GEN_039_03x02_02_07
Surely he started it. Now he talks nonsense about a fight!
$GEN_039_03x02_02_08
He started it, stealing from me.
$GEN_039_05x06_03_QTitle
What did the victim steal from you?
$GEN_039_05x06_03_00
What did the victim steal from you?
$GEN_039_05x06_03_01
Pomeroy copied the entire “S” section from my dictionary into his own book.
$GEN_039_05x06_03_02
How can you be so sure?
$GEN_039_05x06_03_03
You need but look for the entry “Saturian – an alloy consisting of copper, zinc, and gold used by ancient Romans to produce coins.”
$GEN_039_05x06_03_04
And what does that prove?
$GEN_039_05x06_03_05
It was a hoax, which means “a falsehood deliberately pretending to be the truth”. There is no such thing as saturian! I made it up so that I should know if someone ever mindlessly copied my dictionary!
$GEN_039_05x06_03_06
Are you not misleading your own readers?
$GEN_039_05x06_03_07
Of course not. Nobody would look for that entry as I made it up.
