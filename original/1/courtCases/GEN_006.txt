The defendant is Valérie Moreau, <a name="1" class="hidden">daughter of advocate Philippe Moreau</a>. She was arrested as a suspect for the murder of Lieutenant Serge Mollet, <a name="2" class="hidden">a cavalry officer</a>. The investigation revealed that they knew each other well and, according to both families, met several times a month. What’s more, Lieutenant Mollet had asked Philippe Moreau <a name="3" class="hidden">for his daughter’s hand</a>.
$GEN_006_DOC_01_01
Miss Moreau testified that she had <a name="4" class="hidden">found her friend’s body</a> in his apartment. She was arrested because the servants testified that nobody else had <a name="5" class="hidden">entered Lieutenant Mollet’s apartment</a> on that day, and the servants had seen the victim alive before her arrival.
$GEN_006_DOC_01_02
Miss Moreau testified that she was allowed into the house by Lieutenant Mollet’s servants and went directly to his room. She said that she saw him lying in bed in bloodstained bedclothes and his <a name="6" class="hidden">throat had been cut</a>. Even though she supposedly felt faint, she approached him to <a name="7" class="hidden">check his pulse</a>. A few minutes later, she called for help.
$GEN_006_DOC_01_03
The servants’ testimonies corroborate her account. When they found her, she was <a name="8" class="hidden">holding Lieutenant Mollet’s body</a> in her arms and sobbing uncontrollably. A bloodstained knife was lying on the floor, and on its still wet hilt there were small, probably female, fingerprints.
$GEN_006_DOC_01_04
The case seems simple: Miss Moreau is one of the aggrieved parties, and dragging her to court will only cause her more distress. We should focus on looking for the real murderer, and not harass such fragile and innocent creatures.
$GEN_006_DOC_01_05
Evidence: <a name="10" class="hidden">A bloodstained knife.</a>
$GEN_006_OnStart_00
Young, pretty, and unhappy. No wonder people take her side.
$GEN_006_OnStart_01
Heartless rogues! How can you drag a girl in mourning to court?!
$GEN_006_OnStart_02
Silence! Please, introduce yourself.
$GEN_006_OnStart_03
My name is Valérie Moreau.
$GEN_006_OnStart_04
Miss Moreau, you are accused of murdering Lieutenant Mollet…
$GEN_006_OnStart_05
…
$GEN_006_OnStart_06
Do you have anything to say?
$GEN_006_OnStart_07
I still cannot believe… any of this.
$GEN_006_OnStart_08
Spare us the drama please, this is not a theatre.
$GEN_006_OnStart_09
Sadist!
$GEN_006_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Citizen Valérie Moreau to be guillotined! Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_006_OnGuilty_01
We certainly did a fine job.
$GEN_006_OnGuilty_02
This is inhuman!
$GEN_006_OnGuilty_03
She’s a lunatic, she deserves it!
$GEN_006_OnPrison_00
I sentence Citizen Valérie Moreau to prison! Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_006_OnPrison_01
We saw right through her, though I would rather see her at the guillotine.
$GEN_006_OnPrison_02
This is inhuman!
$GEN_006_OnPrison_03
She’s a lunatic, she deserves it!
$GEN_006_OnNotGuilty_00
The verdict for the murder of Lieutenant Mollet is… not guilty! Please release Miss Moreau.
$GEN_006_OnNotGuilty_01
You let her sweet eyes deceive you?
$GEN_006_OnNotGuilty_02
Huzzah!
$GEN_006_OnNotGuilty_03
You let a murderer go free?
$GEN_006_01x02_00_QTitle
Have you known the victim for a long time?
$GEN_006_01x02_00_00
Have you known the victim for a long time?
$GEN_006_01x02_00_01
A few years, since his time at Military School.
$GEN_006_01x02_00_02
What kind of acquaintance was it?
$GEN_006_01x02_00_03
Friendship. Deep, steadfast friendship. Although for Lieutenant Mollet, I knew that it was something more than that.
$GEN_006_01x02_00_04
And for you?
$GEN_006_01x02_00_05
Why is he tormenting her?
$GEN_006_01x02_00_06
…
$GEN_006_01x02_00_07
Did you love him? If you did, maybe you murdered him because you were jealous.
$GEN_006_01x02_00_08
I do not know… I cannot answer that question.
$GEN_006_01x02_00_09
Refusing to answer will only go against you.
$GEN_006_01x02_00_10
She’s barely breathing, the poor, traumatised thing.
$GEN_006_01x03_01_QTitle
Miss Moreau, I must learn every detail of this case.
$GEN_006_01x03_01_00
Miss Moreau, I must learn every detail of this case.
$GEN_006_01x03_01_01
I understand. Please, ask your questions.
$GEN_006_01x03_01_02
Our investigator has learned from your father that Lieutenant Mollet was in agreement with him about your engagement.
$GEN_006_01x03_01_03
Oh…
$GEN_006_01x03_01_04
Did you not know of that agreement?
$GEN_006_01x03_01_05
I knew that he… But not that soon. No, I did not know.
$GEN_006_01x03_01_06
Your family kept it a secret?
$GEN_006_01x03_01_07
Apparently so.
$GEN_006_01x03_01_08
Maybe you reacted to his proposal by killing him?
$GEN_006_01x03_01_09
<sobs>
$GEN_006_01x03_01_10
My God, why not just execute her at once, you bastards!
$GEN_006_01x04_02_QTitle
Please describe the moment when you found the victim’s body.
$GEN_006_01x04_02_00
Please describe the moment when you found the victim’s body.
$GEN_006_01x04_02_01
This is inhuman.
$GEN_006_01x04_02_02
I received a letter in which he asked me to come. He wrote that he would send everyone away and we could spend some time… on our own. He wanted to confess something.
$GEN_006_01x04_02_03
On your own? How should we interpret that?
$GEN_006_01x04_02_04
He surely did not mean anything indecent. He was an honourable person, a cavalryman.
$GEN_006_01x04_02_05
What happened next?
$GEN_006_01x04_02_06
I arrived on time and entered his apartment. The drapes were closed and I felt something slippery beneath my shoe. It was blood…
$GEN_006_01x04_02_07
Did anyone see you entering?
$GEN_006_01x04_02_08
I do not know. The servants perhaps.
$GEN_006_01x04_02_09
Did you sneak in there?
$GEN_006_01x04_02_10
I… He asked me to enter quietly, and when I went inside…
$GEN_006_01x04_02_11
You immediately saw the body?
$GEN_006_01x04_02_12
It was only after a few moments that I saw him. He was lying on the bed… his throat… Excuse me…
$GEN_006_01x04_02_13
How awful…
$GEN_006_10x06_03_QTitle
Lieutenant Mollet was a soldier. How could someone…?
$GEN_006_10x06_03_00
Lieutenant Mollet was a soldier. How could someone have surprised him in his own bed?
$GEN_006_10x06_03_01
How would such a child be able to kill him? This trial is a farce.
$GEN_006_10x06_03_02
Of course she could. You can kill anyone if you are able to surprise them.
$GEN_006_10x06_03_03
Whoever broke into his flat must have approached him very silently to not wake him up.
$GEN_006_10x06_03_04
Would he be sleeping right before meeting you?
$GEN_006_10x06_03_05
I only know that he was lying in bed. Maybe he decided to take a nap?
$GEN_006_10x06_03_06
Do you not find that suspicious?
$GEN_006_10x06_03_07
Everything about this case is suspicious.
$GEN_006_10x06_03_08
I agree, and your testimony especially.
$GEN_006_04x07_04_QTitle
How could you be sure the victim was already dead?
$GEN_006_04x07_04_00
How could you be sure the victim was already dead?
$GEN_006_04x07_04_01
I was speaking to him, saying, “Wake up, come one, get up.” I was pulling on his sleeve, but he was just lying there… blood dripping…
$GEN_006_04x07_04_02
She’s raving, poor child.
$GEN_006_04x07_04_03
Leave her alone!
$GEN_006_04x07_04_04
Was Lieutenant Mollet dead?
$GEN_006_04x07_04_05
I listened for breath, but there was none… I listened for a long time, desperately wanting to hear it…
$GEN_006_04x07_04_06
Why did you not call for help?
$GEN_006_04x07_04_07
I was in shock.
$GEN_006_04x07_04_08
Then why were you not screaming? Women usually scream at the top of their lungs when something shocks them.
$GEN_006_04x07_04_09
I cannot explain that.
$GEN_006_04x07_04_10
One screams, another doesn’t. What does it prove?
$GEN_006_09x08_05_QTitle
When the guards arrived, they found you covered in blood.
$GEN_006_09x08_05_00
When the guards arrived, they found you covered in blood. Do you understand how that looks?
$GEN_006_09x08_05_01
You think that it was me who killed him. I am not stupid, I know why I am standing here.
$GEN_006_09x08_05_02
That is right. Would you like to respond to that?
$GEN_006_09x08_05_03
Maybe I really killed him…?
$GEN_006_09x08_05_04
She admitted to being guilty!
$GEN_006_09x08_05_05
Pardon?
$GEN_006_09x08_05_06
Maybe if I came earlier… Maybe he would be still alive?
$GEN_006_09x08_05_07
Please do not take your words back.
$GEN_006_09x08_05_08
Good God, stop tormenting her!
$GEN_006_09x08_05_09
Calm down and answer the question. Did you cut Lieutenant Mollet’s throat?
$GEN_006_09x08_05_10
No.
$GEN_006_09x08_05_11
Yet, I just heard her say something different.
$GEN_006_05x09_06_QTitle
Did Lieutenant Mollet have any enemies?
$GEN_006_05x09_06_00
Did Lieutenant Mollet have any enemies?
$GEN_006_05x09_06_01
I don’t know. He had friends.
$GEN_006_05x09_06_02
Could a friend have killed him?
$GEN_006_05x09_06_03
…
$GEN_006_05x09_06_04
Only someone he trusted could have got that close to him, no? Yet the servants say there was nobody else in that apartment except for you.
$GEN_006_05x09_06_05
I would like to be an officer’s wife… The servants have no such chance.
$GEN_006_05x09_06_06
Did you see anyone else in the apartment?
$GEN_006_05x09_06_07
No.
$GEN_006_05x09_06_08
If it was not you, then who killed Lieutenant Mollet?
$GEN_006_05x09_06_09
I would like to know that as much as you…
$GEN_006_01x10_07_QTitle
A bloodstained knife was found at the crime scene.
$GEN_006_01x10_07_00
A bloodstained knife was found at the crime scene.
$GEN_006_01x10_07_01
I know nothing about a knife.
$GEN_006_01x10_07_02
It has an imprint of a small, probably female, hand.
$GEN_006_01x10_07_03
So he was killed by a woman? He had someone else, but wanted to marry me…?
$GEN_006_01x10_07_04
I did not say that.
$GEN_006_01x10_07_05
I am rather confused.
$GEN_006_01x10_07_06
Poor girl.
$GEN_006_01x10_07_07
Monsieur le juge, the accused is trying to deceive us. We know what a woman’s imprint on the murder weapon means.
$GEN_006_01x10_07_08
Maybe I left it when Serge was already dead?
$GEN_006_01x10_07_09
She probably grabbed it in a shock.
$GEN_006_PlotTwist_00
Monsieur le juge! I made it on time. There is something I have to reveal. Please, hear me out!
$GEN_006_PlotTwist_01
I know Miss Moreau. I treat her family.
$GEN_006_PlotTwist_02
What do you want to reveal?
$GEN_006_PlotTwist_03
I think it was this woman who killed Lieutenant Mollet. She is the Devil incarnate!
$GEN_006_PlotTwist_04
Madman!
$GEN_006_WIT_00_A_QTitle
What brings you to that conclusion?
$GEN_006_WIT_00_A_00
What brings you to that conclusion?
$GEN_006_WIT_00_A_01
I have been treating her for many years, and have known her since she was a child. Recently, she changed. When Miss Moreau visited me not long ago, she was trembling, constantly getting a fever, and having fits of terror. I prescribed her some herbs to calm her down–
$GEN_006_WIT_00_A_02
And what is the connection with–
$GEN_006_WIT_00_A_03
Let me tell you! Something was tormenting her inwardly. She told me once that she was too young for marriage.
$GEN_006_WIT_00_A_04
We have a motive.
$GEN_006_WIT_00_A_05
So she knew what Lieutenant Mollet and her father were planning?
$GEN_006_WIT_00_A_06
If she did not, she at least suspected something, as for some time her nerves have been on edge.
$GEN_006_WIT_00_B_QTitle
This is a serious accusation…
$GEN_006_WIT_00_B_00
This is a serious accusation…
$GEN_006_WIT_00_B_01
She has been dealing with trauma. A few years ago, she saw a man die in the street, a victim of a clash between Royalists and Jacobins. She was standing close to him when a stray bullet hit him in the head.
$GEN_006_WIT_00_B_02
What does that have to do with the Lieutenant’s death?
$GEN_006_WIT_00_B_03
We talked about it many scores of times. In the beginning Valérie was silent. In time she began to share minor details. At one point, however, she started describing the deceased in such detail that you could almost see his body yourself.
$GEN_006_WIT_00_B_04
Go on.
$GEN_006_WIT_00_B_05
During one of our conversations she admitted to imagining that scene during the night. She wanted to tell the story again and again, and I could see how fascinated she had become with it.
$GEN_006_WIT_00_B_06
What could that mean, in your opinion?
$GEN_006_WIT_00_B_07
It is possible that she has become fascinated by death and violence.
$GEN_006_WIT_01_A_QTitle
How did you react to that?
$GEN_006_WIT_01_A_00
How did you react to that?
$GEN_006_WIT_01_A_01
I thought she was still in shock after what she had seen and I prescribed her sedative herbs. I assumed that she would get married, have a child, and forget about everything… It was only today that I heard about Lieutenant Mollet’s death and I came here at once.
$GEN_006_WIT_01_A_02
Thank you, doctor.
$GEN_006_WIT_02_A_QTitle
It seems that you have treated us to quite a performance!
$GEN_006_WIT_02_A_00
It seems that you have treated us to quite a performance! The doctor is accusing you–
$GEN_006_WIT_02_A_01
Bastard! If he is making a monster of me, perhaps I should butcher him for pleasure?! Stick a knife in his belly and cut upwards! Slash open his throat and…
$GEN_006_WIT_02_A_02
What is she talking about?
$GEN_006_WIT_03_A_QTitle
What we have here is the serious opinion of a doctor…
$GEN_006_WIT_03_A_00
What we have here is the serious opinion of a doctor–
$GEN_006_WIT_03_A_01
I just remembered! I know who killed Serge. I recall him telling me that a couple of years ago he duelled another officer who never accepted his defeat. Maybe…
$GEN_006_WIT_03_A_02
And maybe that person, infuriated by the denial of an honourable way out, sneaked into Lieutenant Mollet’s home to cut his throat? After so many years?
$GEN_006_WIT_03_A_03
…
$GEN_006_WIT_03_A_04
Do you know the name of that other officer, Miss?
$GEN_006_WIT_03_A_05
Unfortunately, I do not.
$GEN_006_WIT_03_A_06
What manner of duel was it? Did they use swords or pistols?
$GEN_006_WIT_03_A_07
I… do not remember that either.
