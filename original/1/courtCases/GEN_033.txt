Marcel Bloch, a 26-year-old court guard from the north of France. Directly before the beginning of the Revolution, he served as an artilleryman in the 2nd section of the 2nd company, the 2nd battalion of the Colonel-General’s regiment. After 1789, he moved to Paris and <a name="2" class="hidden">joined the court guard</a>, where he still works. His superiors and colleagues describe him as an exemplary and committed employee.
$GEN_033_DOC_01_01
During a few drinks at a local inn, Marcel admitted that all these years he has been <a name="3" class="hidden">lying</a> about ever serving in the army. Military service was a prerequisite for joining the court guard. A thorough investigation led to the suspicion that Bloch <a name="4" class="hidden">had forged the documents</a> that proved his experience in the army.
$GEN_033_DOC_01_02
The investigators found two <a name="5" class="hidden">artillerymen from the section</a> Marcel Bloch claimed to serve in, Pierre Richard and Michel Montand. They denied remembering Bloch, and a document from his former commander was obtained.

Colonel Chabert's statement:
$GEN_033_DOC_02_01
I hereby declare that the name Marcel Bloch does not appear in the records of the 2nd demi-brigade. Nor was I able to find him in the records of the pre-Revolutionary Colonel-General’s regiment. Please bear in mind that the aforementioned records are incomplete – part of the documentation was destroyed by soldiers at the beginning of the Revolution in connection with its support by the infantry corps. Colonel J. C. Chabert; Commander of the 2nd demi-brigade

Please mention in the protocol that the Court already recognises the identity of the defendant, Marcel Bloch, a court guard at this same court house. Citizen, do you understand the charges against you?
$GEN_033_OnStart_01
No, monsieur le juge…
$GEN_033_OnStart_02
You were accused of forging a document that proved your military experience. You claimed to have served in the 2nd battalion of the pre-Revolutionary Colonel-General’s regiment, currently known as the 2nd demi-brigade. According to the indictment, you lied in order to be hired by the court.
$GEN_033_OnStart_03
Bloch could have benefited much more from his crime.
$GEN_033_OnStart_04
I will bear that in mind. How do you plead?
$GEN_033_OnStart_05
Monsieur le juge, I swear that I have not deceived anyone!
$GEN_033_OnStart_06
I am afraid that evidence and circumstance say otherwise.
$GEN_033_OnStart_07
Too afraid to go to war, but still hungry for medals.
$GEN_033_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Marcel Bloch to be guillotined! Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_033_OnGuilty_01
Poor fella.
$GEN_033_OnGuilty_02
Make an example of him for others who may try such a thing.
$GEN_033_OnNotGuilty_00
The judgement for Marcel Bloch is… not guilty! Take the defendant away.
$GEN_033_OnNotGuilty_01
I hope they will at least dismiss him from the court. Otherwise he will be laughing in your face.
$GEN_033_OnNotGuilty_02
He got lucky.
$GEN_033_04x06_00_QTitle
How did you get your certificate of service in the regiment?
$GEN_033_04x06_00_00
How did you get your certificate of service in the regiment?
$GEN_033_04x06_00_01
It was issued by Colonel Chabert, my commander.
$GEN_033_04x06_00_02
We asked Colonel Chabert for a statement. He claims that your name does not appear in the unit's records. Are we supposed to believe that the same person also issued you a document saying otherwise?
$GEN_033_04x06_00_03
There are also the testimonies of ordinary soldiers.
$GEN_033_04x06_00_04
I don’t understand any of this. I served in that unit for over a year. The Colonel himself signed my papers!
$GEN_033_04x06_00_05
What do you not understand? You forged his signature, that is all.
$GEN_033_04x06_00_06
Throw that scoundrel to the soldiers. Let them judge him!
$GEN_033_01x03_01_QTitle
Did you serve in the artillery?
$GEN_033_01x03_01_00
Did you serve in the artillery?
$GEN_033_01x03_01_01
Yes, in the famous double two’s – the 2nd section of the 2nd company.
$GEN_033_01x03_01_02
What cannon did the section operate?
$GEN_033_01x03_01_03
Well… two eight-pounders.
$GEN_033_01x03_01_04
Interesting. Those sections used, and still use, six-pounders.
$GEN_033_01x03_01_05
Are you sure? I must have forgotten, it was so long ago. Being a guard is really important to me–
$GEN_033_01x03_01_06
You are proud of your past in the artillery, but you cannot remember which cannon you were using?
$GEN_033_01x03_01_07
I remember them well. I could load one with my eyes shut! I just made a mistake.
$GEN_033_01x03_01_08
He wouldn’t know which end to put the ball in.
$GEN_033_03x05_02_QTitle
Tell us the names of some of your comrades from that period.
$GEN_033_03x05_02_00
Tell us the names of some of your comrades from that period.
$GEN_033_03x05_02_01
Charles Clary and Jean Gayet, my closest friends from the section.
$GEN_033_03x05_02_02
Could they confirm the authenticity of your papers?
$GEN_033_03x05_02_03
Of course they could, but I don’t know where to find them now. They all came from northern France, like I did.
$GEN_033_03x05_02_04
You don’t keep in touch? But you just said they were your closest friends.
$GEN_033_03x05_02_05
Everyone went their own way. That usually happens in the Army.
$GEN_033_03x05_02_06
We were able to contact your other compatriots, Pierre Richard and Michel Montand. Are those names familiar?
$GEN_033_03x05_02_07
No, I don’t remember them.
$GEN_033_03x05_02_08
Really? They served in the same 2nd battalion as you. And, what a surprise, they don’t remember you either. They are here, in Paris.
$GEN_033_03x05_02_09
That doesn’t prove anything, thousands of people pass through the regiment. I wasn’t friendly with all my comrades. I never even had a chance to talk with some of them. You have to believe me…
$GEN_033_01x02_03_QTitle
Why did you join the court guard?
$GEN_033_01x02_03_00
Why did you join the court guard?
$GEN_033_01x02_03_01
I came to Paris hoping to find a better life after the Revolution began. A court guard seemed well paid and… people respect the uniform, monsieur le juge.
$GEN_033_01x02_03_02
Was that important to you? To wear a uniform?
$GEN_033_01x02_03_03
My father fought in the war. He used to say that the uniform is much more than just clothing.
$GEN_033_01x02_03_04
He wanted to see you in the Army?
$GEN_033_01x02_03_05
He didn’t say that, but he wasn’t a man of many words. He kept the buttons from his uniform, you know, the shiny golden ones, in his drawer.
$GEN_033_01x02_03_06
Did you trick the Parisian court to fulfil a childhood dream?
$GEN_033_01x02_03_07
I simply joined the army and risked my life. Father was right – you feel different in a uniform, more honourable.
$GEN_033_01x02_03_08
They probably didn’t want him in the army, so he started lying.
$GEN_033_03x04_04_QTitle
Did you forge a certificate of military service?
$GEN_033_03x04_04_00
Did you forge a certificate of military service?
$GEN_033_03x04_04_01
I didn’t, and I wouldn’t even know how. I don’t know anything about forgery.
$GEN_033_03x04_04_02
You said something different in the inn.
$GEN_033_03x04_04_03
I was drunk and stupid. I was just messing around to try and impress people. I wasn’t thinking about the possible consequences…
$GEN_033_03x04_04_04
As a proud artilleryman, you should not be fond of such jokes.
$GEN_033_03x04_04_05
Sometimes when I drink too much I don’t think before I speak, and that time I’d had a lot to drink.
$GEN_033_03x04_04_06
I suppose you really did not think much at all since you were telling this to a person who works at the court.
$GEN_033_03x04_04_07
Monsieur le juge, I sincerely apologise, but is it really necessary to punish people for whatever gibberish they produce after a few strong glasses?
$GEN_033_03x04_04_08
His conscience kept bugging him and he finally spilled the beans.
