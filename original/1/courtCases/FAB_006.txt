Marie-Sylvie Pache, daughter of the Mayor of Paris, has been accused of the <a name="1" class="hidden">cold-blooded murder</a> of Béatrice Caron.
$FAB_006_DOC_01_01
The arrest was made in an <a name="2" class="hidden">abandoned house</a> on rue Saint-Maur, where the defendant supposedly copulated with the victim many times. The shack was perfectly suited for trysts intended to be kept a secret. The detention took place with the personal assistance of Judge Fidèle. According to the Guard, the defendant was found standing over the deceased with a blood-stained <a name="4" class="hidden">kitchen knife in her hand</a>, ascertained to be the murder weapon. The defendant put up <a name="5" class="hidden">no resistance</a> during her arrest.
$FAB_006_DOC_01_02
Investigators have established that the defendant and the victim knew each other for a long time. They were seen together often, however, acquaintances of the defendant suggest that she preferred not to boast about her father’s position, or even her <a name="7" class="hidden">real name</a>. Béatrice, on the other hand, in the absence of the defendant, allegedly bragged about… excuse my language, monsieur le juge, she bragged about having <a name="8" class="hidden">“often fucked”</a> the defendant. I suspect this is just the silly prattle of a young girl. Nevertheless, I am reporting what I have learned.
$FAB_006_DOC_01_03
There are plenty of assumptions and gossip in this case. Béatrice had some connections with the Muscadins, but we were unable to learn anything of value from them. Rumour has it she was very much like this mob of delinquents – young, unruly, disrespectful of authority, and depraving the sober-minded youth. At the same time, she usurped the right to call herself a defender of the people. Béatrice was a Muscadin to the core, and it would appear the defendant wished to become much the same.

The blackmailer’s letter
$FAB_006_DOC_02_00
Marie, I have been betrayed by your world. I have become a traitor, an Austrian bitch, and <a name="9" class="hidden">somebody must pay</a> for my shame and pain. That person is you. Come to our place in the evening with <a name="10" class="hidden">3,000 francs</a>. If you do not, I will tell everyone that you are a spy too, and you will be called a treacherous whore, just as I am now.
$FAB_006_OnStart_00
Although many of you know this face already, I call upon the defendant to introduce herself.
$FAB_006_OnStart_01
Marie-Sylvie Pache, daughter–
$FAB_006_OnStart_02
Yes, we know.
$FAB_006_OnGuilty_00
For murder, I sentence Marie-Sylvie Pache to death.
$FAB_006_OnGuilty_01
It was clear from the beginning.
$FAB_006_OnGuilty_02
I don’t even feel sorry for her.
$FAB_006_OnGuilty_03
Had she got herself a man, this would have ended differently.
$FAB_006_OnPrison_00
Marie-Sylvie Pache, there is no doubt you committed the crime. I sentence you to prison, and hope you appreciate our lenience.
$FAB_006_OnPrison_01
I personally do not see why she should not visit the guillotine.
$FAB_006_OnPrison_02
Perhaps someone in prison will help her go straight.
$FAB_006_OnNotGuilty_00
I have taken your testimony and find you not guilty.
$FAB_006_OnNotGuilty_01
But you caught her red-handed yourself!
$FAB_006_OnNotGuilty_02
What?
$FAB_006_OnNotGuilty_03
Why?
$FAB_006_OnNotGuilty_04
The judge surely prefers boys himself and sympathises with her.
$FAB_006_01x02_00_QTitle
Why did you choose this particular place to murder your victim?
$FAB_006_01x02_00_00
Why did you choose this particular place to murder your victim?
$FAB_006_01x02_00_01
It was not me who chose the place, but Béatrice… And I had no intention of murdering anyone.
$FAB_006_01x02_00_02
There would be no witnesses to the crime there.
$FAB_006_01x02_00_03
A crime was committed every time we met there – a crime of misalliance, a crime of sex and bodies. We relied on having no witnesses.
$FAB_006_01x02_00_04
So, they did in fact… well.
$FAB_006_01x05_01_QTitle
You offered no resistance during the arrest. Why were you so calm?
$FAB_006_01x05_01_00
You offered no resistance during the arrest. Why were you so calm?
$FAB_006_01x05_01_01
I know what I have done, and I do not deny a thing.
$FAB_006_01x05_01_02
And you are aware that punishment will be fatal for a crime such as this? Perhaps you should have tried to save yourself?
$FAB_006_01x05_01_03
Our family reputation has been tarnished by these accusations against my father, the person whom… Béatrice turned out to be a blackmailer. What would I save? My life? What life?!
$FAB_006_01x05_01_04
You mean you murdered this woman in cold blood because she hurt your family?
$FAB_006_01x05_01_05
She’s not even denying it. What a fool!
$FAB_006_01x06_02_QTitle
You murdered a good friend.
$FAB_006_01x06_02_00
You murdered a good friend.
$FAB_006_01x06_02_01
The knife went into her as it would any stranger.
$FAB_006_01x06_02_02
You speak without any trace of emotion. How is that possible?
$FAB_006_01x06_02_03
When I received Béatrice’s letter, my heart turned to ice and I saw the true colours of the world – treachery, egotism, ruthlessness.
$FAB_006_01x06_02_04
She’s young, rich, and foolish.
$FAB_006_02x07_03_QTitle
What if the owner of the house that you occupied for your trysts had returned?
$FAB_006_02x07_03_00
What if the owner of the house that you occupied for your trysts had returned?
$FAB_006_02x07_03_01
We did not occupy the house, that conclusion is ridiculous.
$FAB_006_02x07_03_02
The mayor’s daughter wanted to demonstrate she had power. How aristocratic.
$FAB_006_02x07_03_03
I am not an aristocrat, I come from the common people. The poorer Citizens of Paris accepted me as their own because they could see that I care about them.
$FAB_006_02x07_03_04
They accepted you because they did not know you were the daughter of an important figure.
$FAB_006_02x07_03_05
Perhaps, Prosecutor Tinville. There is indeed the possibility that my life and dreams were truly that pathetic.
$FAB_006_02x07_03_06
She occupied the house because she wanted to show off to others how important she was!
$FAB_006_02x07_03_07
You are just babbling…
$FAB_006_02x04_04_QTitle
Where did you get the knife?
$FAB_006_02x04_04_00
Where did you get the knife?
$FAB_006_02x04_04_01
We needed to cut bread sometimes when we were hungry. I had taken it there before and it was just lying around.
$FAB_006_02x04_04_02
Did you plan this crime in advance?
$FAB_006_02x04_04_03
No… I said… Will anyone listen to me? I said I had taken the kitchen knife from my house to be able to–
$FAB_006_02x04_04_04
I bet it was all silver! I heard the mayor was a rich man.
$FAB_006_02x04_04_05
Well, what difference does it make what I say if your minds are closed to my words?
$FAB_006_02x04_04_06
Austrian bitch!
$FAB_006_02x04_04_07
Tribade! Fricatrice!
$FAB_006_02x04_04_08
Do not dare to offend the people!
$FAB_006_04x05_05_QTitle
During arrest, you handed the murder weapon to me.
$FAB_006_04x05_05_00
During arrest, you handed the murder weapon to me.
$FAB_006_04x05_05_01
I gave it to the right person.
$FAB_006_04x05_05_02
Please explain.
$FAB_006_04x05_05_03
I handed the knife to the head butcher of the city. A man who knows that the instrument was meant for him. He will smell blood long after my death.
$FAB_006_04x05_05_04
Those atrocities with another woman have mixed up her head!
$FAB_006_04x05_05_05
You will remember my words, Judge Fidèle – this knife will get you one day.
$FAB_006_04x05_05_06
The defendant is trying to intimidate the Judge!
$FAB_006_06x08_06_QTitle
How long had you been in an intimate relationship with the victim?
$FAB_006_06x08_06_00
How long had you been in an intimate relationship with the victim?
$FAB_006_06x08_06_01
For one year. It started–
$FAB_006_06x08_06_02
Do we have to listen to these perverted effusions?
$FAB_006_06x08_06_03
The prisoner has the right to defend herself. If her testimony is too much for you, Prosecutor Tinville, I can finish this trial by myself.
$FAB_006_06x08_06_04
I will stay.
$FAB_006_06x08_06_05
I ask the defendant to continue.
$FAB_006_06x08_06_06
It started… no, I do not want to expose my feelings to those who believe them to be something against nature. You have likened me to an animal already.
$FAB_006_06x08_06_07
Your testimony could help in–
$FAB_006_06x08_06_08
Yes, I killed Béatrice because I am a degenerate monster. A freak! Is that what you wanted to hear?
$FAB_006_06x08_06_09
That’s right, monster!
$FAB_006_03x07_07_QTitle
Do you know how I learned of your meeting?
$FAB_006_03x07_07_00
Do you know how I learned of your meeting?
$FAB_006_03x07_07_01
I had begun to wonder about that in the prison cell.
$FAB_006_03x07_07_02
Béatrice Caron testified she was an Austrian spy and that she kept in touch with you only to spy on your father.
$FAB_006_03x07_07_03
That is absurd.
$FAB_006_03x07_07_04
It is not easy to accept the truth.
$FAB_006_03x07_07_05
You seek to turn our affections into a mere political game. Love is on a somewhat different level.
$FAB_006_03x07_07_06
Disgusting.
$FAB_006_03x07_07_07
They loved each other so much that one ended up killing the other.
$FAB_006_03x07_07_08
It is you who are disgusting – you and your parochial world. The Revolution has failed at opening your minds, hearts, and souls.
$FAB_006_10x09_08_QTitle
Please describe your feelings when you got the letter from Béatrice.
$FAB_006_10x09_08_00
Please describe your feelings when you got the letter from Béatrice.
$FAB_006_10x09_08_01
My heart broke.
$FAB_006_10x09_08_02
So, we have confirmation of the motive.
$FAB_006_10x09_08_03
You truly are ingenious investigators. Finally, you have grasped what I have been telling you from the beginning. Béatrice was very dear to me, like–
$FAB_006_10x09_08_04
Don’t let her say it aloud!
$FAB_006_10x09_08_05
Please, spare us the details.
$FAB_006_10x09_08_06
Well, of course, because your holy hearts would not stand the idea of two women being together. Where is that freedom and equality of yours?
$FAB_006_10x07_09_QTitle
To the best of your knowledge, how would the victim have spent the money she demanded?
$FAB_006_10x07_09_00
To the best of your knowledge, how would the victim have spent the money she demanded?
$FAB_006_10x07_09_01
I do not know, we talked little about money. We talked about pain. Mainly my own.
$FAB_006_10x07_09_02
You supposedly knew the victim very well.
$FAB_006_10x07_09_03
We did not talk about money, we were not planning a future together – everyone knows that would not be possible…
$FAB_006_10x07_09_04
And for the better!
$FAB_006_10x07_09_05
Away with this abomination!
$FAB_006_10x07_09_06
As you can see…
$FAB_006_10x07_09_07
That money would likely have been used to further develop the Austrian spy ring in France.
$FAB_006_10x07_09_08
What makes you think so?
$FAB_006_10x07_09_09
You are not here to ask questions.

Why are you staring at me? Do you see a victory here?
$FAB_006_UNIQUE_QUESTION_00
The Muscadins did not recognise the defendant? Why?
$FAB_006_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_00_00
She concealed her true surname.
$FAB_006_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_00_00
They did recognise her, but did not care.
$FAB_006_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_00_01
The defendant skilfully blended into the crowd.
$FAB_006_UNIQUE_QUESTION_01
Did the defendant confirm being sexually involved with the victim?
$FAB_006_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_01_00
Yes.
$FAB_006_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_00
No.
$FAB_006_UNIQUE_QUESTION_02
Where did the accused get the murder weapon?
$FAB_006_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_02_00
She brought it from her house.
$FAB_006_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_02_00
Austrian spies gave it to her.
$FAB_006_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_02_01
She bought it at the market right before the meeting.
