In the dock is Geneviève Lussier, a resident of the Section Bonne-Nouvelle, rue Poissonnière. Citizen Lussier is employed as a <a name="1" class="hidden">seamstress</a>, but each Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday she works at night as a caretaker at a warehouse on rue de Cléry. When asked why he would employ a woman in a specifically male position, the owner of the warehouse, Antoine Tellier, replied, “All the men went to war and there’s no one left to work.”
$GEN_002_DOC_1_01
She is accused of stealing <a name="3" class="hidden">one sixth</a> of the contents of the barrels of <a name="4" class="hidden">cane sugar</a> that were imported from the colonies. Citizen Tellier claims that the incident occurred sometime between last Friday night and Saturday morning, during Geneviève Lussier’s shift. He would also like to enlighten us about the current price of sugar – it is high.
$GEN_002_DOC_1_02
The owner testified – which has been confirmed through an on-site investigation – that no windows were broken, and neither the front nor the back door were forced open. After ending her shift, Citizen Lussier did not report any unusual occurrences.
$GEN_002_DOC_1_03
The missing sugar was reported by the workers from the morning shift. The investigators went through the register and found that for some time there have been small losses after night shifts.

Antoine Tellier’s testimony
$GEN_002_DOC_2_00
Antoine Tellier’s testimony: “Mrs Lussier has been working for me for some time, and I had <a name="9" class="hidden">complete trust</a> in her. That’s why I didn’t react before when I noticed small amounts of merchandise missing – just the <a name="10">usual business losses</a>, I thought. This time, however, someone stole a larger amount, and only Mrs Lussier had access to the goods in question.”
$GEN_002_OnStart_00
The case strikes me as obvious. Or do we not know something?
$GEN_002_OnStart_01
Please introduce yourself.
$GEN_002_OnStart_02
Geneviève Lussier. I’m a seamstress.
$GEN_002_OnStart_03
You stand accused of stealing sugar from Citizen Tellier’s warehouse.
$GEN_002_OnStart_04
I stole nothing! Tellier’s a liar!
$GEN_002_OnStart_05
Spoken like a true thief.
$GEN_002_OnStart_06
He put a woman in jail because rats ate his sugar.
$GEN_002_OnPrison_00
I sentence Citizen Geneviève Lussier to prison!
$GEN_002_OnPrison_01
For a fistful of sugar?!
$GEN_002_OnPrison_02
What will happen to my children now? Will the court take them in?!
$GEN_002_OnPrison_03
The law rules over all people, even parents.
$GEN_002_OnPrison_04
Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_002_OnPrison_05
A curse on you and your family, scoundrel!
$GEN_002_OnNotGuilty_00
The verdict in the case of the missing cane sugar in Citizen Tellier’s warehouse is… not guilty! Please release Mrs Lussier.
$GEN_002_OnNotGuilty_01
I’m sure Tellier will survive, the sly dog.
$GEN_002_OnNotGuilty_02
You can’t put compassion over justice!
$GEN_002_OnGuilty_00
Citizen Lussier, I sentence you to the guillotine!
$GEN_002_OnGuilty_01
For a fistful of sugar?!
$GEN_002_OnGuilty_02
What will happen to my children now? Will the court take them in?!
$GEN_002_OnGuilty_03
The law rules over all people, even parents.
$GEN_002_OnGuilty_04
Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_002_OnGuilty_05
A curse on you and your family, scoundrel!
$GEN_002_01x02_00_QTitle
Why did you choose to take on this extra job?
$GEN_002_01x02_00_00
Why did you choose to take on this extra job?
$GEN_002_01x02_00_01
It wasn’t a choice – I’ve got hungry mouths to feed.
$GEN_002_01x02_00_02
So you started working at the warehouse to steal food?
$GEN_002_01x02_00_03
I don’t even know what’s inside those chests and barrels.
$GEN_002_01x02_00_04
You work as a seamstress by day?
$GEN_002_01x02_00_05
I sew, I wash my children’s clothes, I cook and I clean.
$GEN_002_01x02_00_06
And you spend the evenings at the warehouse?
$GEN_002_01x02_00_07
The evenings? No, monsieur le juge, I’m there the whole night. In the morning, I come back to make breakfast for my children and then I go to sew.
$GEN_002_01x02_00_08
The Revolution was supposed to make things better!
$GEN_002_01x06_01_QTitle
How do you manage to support five children?
$GEN_002_01x06_01_00
How do you manage to support five children? There’s no mention of a Mr Lussier anywhere in the files.
$GEN_002_01x06_01_01
Mr Lussier heeded the call of arms and went to the front. He must’ve liked it, ’cause he decided to stay. Or his corpse did.
$GEN_002_01x06_01_02
Are you trying to evoke compassion in the Grand Jury?
$GEN_002_01x06_01_03
It’s been a long time since that word meant anything to me.
$GEN_002_01x06_01_04
So, you let your husband go to war, despite having children to support?
$GEN_002_01x06_01_05
He didn’t care for my permission. He just announced that he’d return with money and a medal. I think he was just fed up with the noise and his work.
$GEN_002_02x09_02_QTitle
Had Citizen Tellier ever complained about your work before the events in question?
$GEN_002_02x09_02_00
Had Citizen Tellier ever complained about your work before the events in question?
$GEN_002_02x09_02_01
No, never. He’s always smiled at me.
$GEN_002_02x09_02_02
Have you ever been caught doing anything inappropriate?
$GEN_002_02x09_02_03
Never. That’s why Mr Tellier dismissed the second caretaker he used to hire. In the past, there were always two people looking over each other’s shoulders.
$GEN_002_02x09_02_04
But you were left alone.
$GEN_002_02x09_02_05
That’s right.
$GEN_002_02x09_02_06
That was quite convenient for you, wasn’t it? Was it you who persuaded him to get rid of the second guard?
$GEN_002_02x09_02_07
I don’t talk to him. He’s the one in charge, I’m just a servant.
$GEN_002_04x03_03_QTitle
What did you need the sugar for?
$GEN_002_04x03_03_00
What did you need the sugar for?
$GEN_002_04x03_03_01
Nothing, ’cause I didn’t take it.
$GEN_002_04x03_03_02
One sixth of a barrel is quite a lot.
$GEN_002_04x03_03_03
Exactly! What would I use it for? We live on bread and carrots, when they’re available.
$GEN_002_04x03_03_04
You could simply go to the market and sell it. Sugar is expensive, as the city struggles to import it.
$GEN_002_04x03_03_05
How am I supposed to do that when I’m working all day?
$GEN_002_04x03_03_06
Your older children could go. The extra money would not hurt such a big family, surely?
$GEN_002_04x03_03_07
…
$GEN_002_04x03_03_08
The judge wants to sentence her to the galley because of a tad of sugar!
$GEN_002_05x08_04_QTitle
The register indicates that all the losses took place after the night shift.
$GEN_002_05x08_04_00
The register indicates that all the losses took place after the night shift.
$GEN_002_05x08_04_01
So? That’s when the rats come out of their holes.
$GEN_002_05x08_04_02
Have you only worked night shifts?
$GEN_002_05x08_04_03
Yes, but sometimes merchandise is delivered late in the evening, so the carriers could’ve stolen something. I don’t have eyes in the back of my head!
$GEN_002_05x08_04_04
Do you suspect anyone else?
$GEN_002_05x08_04_05
No. The carriers are constantly changing, because it’s such hard work.
$GEN_002_05x08_04_06
Exactly. They were changing, but the sugar was only disappearing during your shifts.
$GEN_002_05x08_04_07
…
$GEN_002_05x08_04_08
Leave her alone already.
$GEN_002_07x08_05_QTitle
Call in the witness Antoine Tellier.
$GEN_002_07x08_05_00
Call in the witness Antoine Tellier.
$GEN_002_07x08_05_02
Please introduce yourself.
$GEN_002_07x08_05_03
Antoine Tellier. I’m a merchant.
$GEN_002_03x10_06_QTitle
Is it possible that this is not theft, but simply the typical loss of merchandise?
$GEN_002_03x10_06_00
Is it possible that this is not theft, but simply the typical loss of merchandise?
$GEN_002_03x10_06_01
I don’t know. But the fact is it’s dark at night, and Tellier doesn’t like the idea of buying additional lanterns. It’s easy to stumble or slip on something.
$GEN_002_03x10_06_02
Do you often see the carriers stumbling on something?
$GEN_002_03x10_06_03
Sometimes, but I usually steer clear of them.
$GEN_002_03x10_06_04
Could it be that someone spilled the sugar that disappeared?
$GEN_002_03x10_06_05
I don’t know, but if one of them accidentally dropped a barrel and spilled its contents, he surely wouldn’t admit to it.
$GEN_002_03x10_06_06
Of course not, they’d accuse the poor thing.
$GEN_002_WIT_00_A_QTitle
Do you have any proof that it was Citizen Lussier…?
$GEN_002_WIT_00_A_00
Do you have any proof that it was Citizen Lussier who stole the unfortunate sugar?
$GEN_002_WIT_00_A_01
I don’t believe anyone else could’ve done it.
$GEN_002_WIT_00_A_02
The warehouse owner knows best what happens there.
$GEN_002_WIT_00_A_03
Boxes and barrels were being unloaded from one of the ships that night. Why her and not one of the carriers?
$GEN_002_WIT_00_A_04
She had a motive. I’ve heard her husband died at war and left her with five children. It all fits.
$GEN_002_WIT_00_A_05
Sound reasonable, does it not?
$GEN_002_WIT_00_B_QTitle
Could it be that the differences found in the register are simply the typical loss of merchandise?
$GEN_002_WIT_00_B_00
Could it be that the differences found in the register are simply the typical loss of merchandise? Someone dropped something, something was spilled…
$GEN_002_WIT_00_B_01
Yes, it could. Until now, I was convinced that was the case.
$GEN_002_WIT_00_B_02
So what led you to consider theft?
$GEN_002_WIT_00_B_03
My workers are strapping fellows! Would they drop and spill something every night? I don’t hire just anyone – only people with strong arms. I’m not in the habit of skimping on good employees!
$GEN_002_WIT_00_B_04
What if one of them was in a difficult situation and stole something for his children?
$GEN_002_WIT_00_B_05
I don’t think so. I pay them better than the caretakers, so they should be doing fine.
$GEN_002_WIT_00_B_06
Equality and fraternity, right?
