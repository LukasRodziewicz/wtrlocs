<a name="1" class="hidden">The Red Priest</a>, Jacques Roux, is accused of plotting to kill politician and journalist Jean-Paul Marat. We have also accused him of stealing money collected on behalf of an ordinary townswoman, <a name="2" class="hidden">the widow Mrs Beaurepaire</a>, as well as illegally keeping documents handed to him by Citizen Capet moments before the latter was guillotined.
$FAB_014_DOC_1_01
In recent years, Roux has become known as one of the most radical men in Paris. His demands have included the distribution of <a name="3" class="hidden">free bread</a>, <a name="4" class="hidden">the abolishment of taxes</a>, and the beheading of anyone who hoards their wealth. The defendant has formed a faction known as the Enragés, the most extreme and aggressive party in France. These people, mostly the poorest sans-culottes, easily believed in the simple solutions offered by Jacques Roux.
$FAB_014_DOC_1_02
During his speeches, Roux made people believe that what he was doing was good for France. However, at the beginning of the year, he incited food riots in which a desperate mob plundered and looted the city, with many suffering injuries. These events took place only weeks after the beheading of Citizen Capet. Roux accompanied him to the guillotine and supposedly received <a name="7" class="hidden">a mysterious package</a>. There is a popular supposition among members of the government that the package could have been delivered by hostile monarchies, containing an order to cause disturbances in France and payment for doing so.
$FAB_014_DOC_1_03
We also submit the partial testimony of a printer who accepted the commission to print the Red Priest’s angry response to Marat’s article in “L’Ami du peuple”.
$FAB_014_DOC_1_04
This man came to my printing shop, and his expression was so menacing that I instinctively scrambled for something to defend myself with. He slammed a pile of papers on the counter with such force that a loaf of bread bounced off a nearby table. I saw Marat’s name on the front page and asked him about it. “Print this,” he said. “They will soon put that miscreant in a <a name="8" class="hidden">wooden box</a>.”
$FAB_014_OnStart_00
Please give your full name.
$FAB_014_OnStart_01
It’s Roux!
$FAB_014_OnStart_02
The Red Priest himself! Is the Judge stupid, or what?
$FAB_014_OnStart_03
Listen to the people, for they have already said everything that is needed.
$FAB_014_OnStart_04
Serious accusations have been made against you, do not try to make our work more difficult.
$FAB_014_OnStart_05
This has all been made up by Marat, Robespierre, and that entire coterie of theirs.
$FAB_014_OnStart_06
You will be able to defend yourself in a moment. First, state your name for the record.
$FAB_014_OnStart_07
Jacques Roux!
$FAB_014_OnStart_08
The Red Priest!
$FAB_014_OnStart_09
Roux!
$FAB_014_OnStart_10
I suggest that the sentence be passed without hearing due to a lack of cooperation.
$FAB_014_OnStart_11
I am asking you one last time.
$FAB_014_OnStart_12
Jacques Roux. Is the purpose of this to humiliate people? We have removed the monarch, but nothing has changed about those in power…
$FAB_014_OnGuilty_00
For theft, plotting with Citizen Capet, and treason against the Republic, I sentence you to be decapitated!
$FAB_014_OnGuilty_01
Did you hear that?
$FAB_014_OnGuilty_02
Take to the streets!
$FAB_014_OnGuilty_03
We will not forgive this!
$FAB_014_OnGuilty_04
Injustice!
$FAB_014_OnGuilty_05
Guillotine the Judge!
$FAB_014_OnGuilty_06
Is this supposed to be a court?!
$FAB_014_OnNotGuilty_00
Jacques Roux is innocent. Thank you all for being here and giving us your attention.
$FAB_014_OnNotGuilty_01
He’s afraid of us!
$FAB_014_OnNotGuilty_02
We’re strong!
$FAB_014_OnNotGuilty_03
Father Roux will lead us!
$FAB_014_OnNotGuilty_04
The time of the rich is over!
$FAB_014_01x05_00_QTitle
Have you been called the Red Priest due to your radical speeches…
$FAB_014_01x05_00_00
Have you been called the Red Priest due to your radical speeches and Revolutionary activity?
$FAB_014_01x05_00_01
Yes, and I am proud of it!
$FAB_014_01x05_00_02
He’s the only one fighting for us!
$FAB_014_01x05_00_03
Among other things, you proclaim the need to hand out food to everyone and also promote the idea of equality?
$FAB_014_01x05_00_04
I am glad you understand this.
$FAB_014_01x05_00_05
Nevertheless, you joined the Catholic Church, which cheated the people of France in the times of Louis and his predecessors.
$FAB_014_01x05_00_06
I helped the people of de Saintes as much as I could, and I was the first among the clergy to join the Revolution! Accusing me of oppressing the people is like accusing a dog of eating all the fruit.
$FAB_014_01x05_00_07
But you knew everything about the organisation you belonged to and the authority that you served.
$FAB_014_01x05_00_08
Show me one man who was harmed by me under the monarchy.
$FAB_014_01x05_00_09
You want us to believe that your parish collected no tithes?!
$FAB_014_01x05_00_10
This man has done more for the Revolution than this entire court!
$FAB_014_02x04_01_QTitle
Call in the widow Mrs Beaurepaire as a witness.
$FAB_014_02x04_01_00
Call in the widow Mrs Beaurepaire as a witness.
$FAB_014_03x06_02_QTitle
Did you call upon the people to take grain from anyone who had it?
$FAB_014_03x06_02_00
Did you call upon the people to take grain from anyone who had it?
$FAB_014_03x06_02_01
Grain, flour, bread, vegetables. From everyone who has more of it than others.
$FAB_014_03x06_02_02
Thank you, God, for this man!
$FAB_014_03x06_02_03
Did you tell the people to just take the food they needed?
$FAB_014_03x06_02_04
If their children are hungry, they have every right to take as much as they can carry.
$FAB_014_03x06_02_05
And what about the children of shopkeepers who were robbed by these people? Not all of them were rich.
$FAB_014_03x06_02_06
Please, define a rich man to me. I say a rich man is the one who eats when others are hungry!
$FAB_014_03x06_02_07
Are we supposed to believe you were hungry when you encouraged the people to start rioting?
$FAB_014_03x06_02_08
I was fasting at the time, and my everyday diet is more than modest.
$FAB_014_03x06_02_09
What did you eat, prosecutor, when we were eating grass?
$FAB_014_03x06_02_10
You must have known the Guard would not stand idly by, and that by sending these people to rob others they were risking their lives.
$FAB_014_03x06_02_11
Had they not gone, they would have died of hunger. At least I tried to save them.
$FAB_014_04x01_03_QTitle
You agitated for the abolishment of taxes, did you not?
$FAB_014_04x01_03_00
You agitated for the abolishment of taxes, did you not?
$FAB_014_04x01_03_01
All those related to food, yes.
$FAB_014_04x01_03_02
But you lived off the tithe, a tax on crops.
$FAB_014_04x01_03_03
People! You can believe me, I was the first one to demand the abolishment of this foolish idea.
$FAB_014_04x01_03_04
It’s true! He’s the only one telling the truth in this rotten city.
$FAB_014_04x01_03_05
Tell me, what was your purpose behind the destruction of the French Army?
$FAB_014_04x01_03_06
Without taxes there would have been no money for the Army.
$FAB_014_04x01_03_07
The Army should be made of Revolutionaries, of the true French. They would not fight for pay.
$FAB_014_04x01_03_08
Out of pure patriotism? I understand, gunpowder will grind itself, and cannon will cast themselves too. You must understand that without taxes, France would soon fall victim to our enemies – and let me remind you that we have many.
$FAB_014_04x01_03_09
This radicalism by Father Roux was only advantageous to Britain and Austria. They must have paid him to stir people up.
$FAB_014_04x01_03_10
My political opponents would surely like to believe that.
$FAB_014_04x01_03_11
At least he wanted to feed us!
$FAB_014_06x07_04_QTitle
Is it true that you accompanied Louis on his way to the guillotine?
$FAB_014_06x07_04_00
Is it true that you accompanied Louis on his way to the guillotine?
$FAB_014_06x07_04_01
That is right.
$FAB_014_06x07_04_02
Witnesses say that he gave you a package.
$FAB_014_06x07_04_03
I wrote about it in the report. He wanted us to give a package containing his personal belongings to his family, but we refused.
$FAB_014_06x07_04_04
That is what you wrote, but do you wish to change your testimony? It may help you if you admit your guilt.
$FAB_014_06x07_04_05
Were there any documents in the package? Any valuables?
$FAB_014_06x07_04_06
Do you honestly think Louis would have trusted someone like me? I, more than anyone, wished for his quick death.
$FAB_014_06x07_04_07
That is what you would say to stave off suspicions if you were an agent.
$FAB_014_06x07_04_08
I saw him. He was standing there, smiling, as we collected Capet’s blood.
$FAB_014_06x07_04_09
Then it is a coincidence that, soon afterwards, you caused disturbances in Paris? Was that Louis’s revenge, an attempt at a coup d’état?
$FAB_014_06x07_04_10
If you are accusing me of this, you could accuse anyone. There is not a person who lives in Paris who cannot be accused of treason today, tomorrow, or a week from now! This is the kind of terror that–
$FAB_014_06x07_04_11
Instigating people to revolt against the Republic is surely something that both Francis II and George III would be thankful for.
$FAB_014_06x07_04_12
I was most thanked by those children who finally had something to eat.
$FAB_014_06x07_04_13
Away with rich men and speculators!
$FAB_014_06x07_04_14
Bread for the people!
$FAB_014_01x08_05_QTitle
What was your conflict with Citizen Marat about?
$FAB_014_01x08_05_00
What was your conflict with Citizen Marat about?
$FAB_014_01x08_05_01
This man first took advantage of my hospitality and then slandered me in public.
$FAB_014_01x08_05_02
What did he write about you?
$FAB_014_01x08_05_03
For example, that I do not believe in God and became a priest with the sole intention of involving myself in politics.
$FAB_014_01x08_05_04
In all honesty, you have dedicated more time to politics than preaching lately.
$FAB_014_01x08_05_05
God loves those who act, not those who talk.
$FAB_014_01x08_05_06
We have a witness who declares that you said the following about Marat, and I quote, “They will soon put that miscreant in a wooden box.” Were you referring to a coffin?
$FAB_014_01x08_05_07
Of course, but that does not mean I wished to kill him.
$FAB_014_01x08_05_08
So you said that because you could not control your anger?
$FAB_014_01x08_05_09
Marat is indeed a true miscreant, a cheat, a Revolutionary in name only, a two-faced–
$FAB_014_01x08_05_10
It is clear you have a grudge against him, and you threatened him with death in public, yet you say you had no ill intentions?
$FAB_014_01x08_05_11
I am a priest. I would not have touched him.
$FAB_014_01x08_05_12
No, but you could have convinced your supporters to do it for you.
$FAB_014_01x08_05_13
For Father Roux, I would kill that cheat even today!
$FAB_014_08x01_06_QTitle
What is the fifth commandment?
$FAB_014_08x01_06_00
What is the fifth commandment?
$FAB_014_08x01_06_01
Thou shalt not kill.
$FAB_014_08x01_06_02
In the Sermon on the Mount, Christ also said, “Do not be angry with your brother, go and be reconciled with them.” Is that not so?
$FAB_014_08x01_06_03
You know the Bible well for a Revolutionary judge.
$FAB_014_08x01_06_04
But you did not want to be reconciled with Marat, instead choosing to threaten the man, and wish him the worst fate possible.
$FAB_014_08x01_06_05
I have sinned–
$FAB_014_08x01_06_06
Do not repent before them!
$FAB_014_08x01_06_07
Be silent, the trial is not over yet. Did you plan to kill Marat?
$FAB_014_08x01_06_08
It is obvious he will not confess. Nevertheless, the circumstantial evidence is strong and betrays him.
$FAB_014_08x01_06_09
Did you hear that? They have no hard evidence, only indirect information that proves nothing!
$FAB_014_08x01_06_10
In a moment of sincerity, you confess to having sinned.
$FAB_014_08x01_06_11
If there is no evidence, what do they want to sentence him for?
$FAB_014_08x01_06_12
I forgot about forgiveness, that is my sin, but I swear to God that your accusations are putrid lies that stink more than a dunghill. You want to get rid of me because the people listen to me!
$FAB_014_WIT_01_A_QTitle
Do you support the demands of Father Roux?
$FAB_014_WIT_01_A_00
Do you support the demands of Father Roux?
$FAB_014_WIT_01_A_01
Of course.
$FAB_014_WIT_01_A_02
Why?
$FAB_014_WIT_01_A_03
He wants food to be taken from the rich, and every day I see how many people in this city are hungry. He is a good man.
$FAB_014_WIT_01_A_04
He is better than the so-called authorities!
$FAB_014_WIT_01_B_QTitle
Mrs Beaurepaire, Father Roux was collecting money to help you, was he not?
$FAB_014_WIT_01_B_00
Mrs Beaurepaire, Father Roux was collecting money to help you, was he not?
$FAB_014_WIT_01_B_01
My husband died suddenly and I was left alone. Paying for the room and bread… You understand, it wasn’t easy for me.
$FAB_014_WIT_01_B_02
And Roux offered to help you?
$FAB_014_WIT_01_B_03
Yes, he was going to collect some money.
$FAB_014_WIT_01_B_04
How much did you receive?
$FAB_014_WIT_01_B_05
I didn’t get anything in the end.
$FAB_014_WIT_01_B_06
Why not?
$FAB_014_WIT_01_B_07
I’m not sure. Maybe someone else needed the money more desperately.
$FAB_014_WIT_01_B_08
Stop pulling him to pieces!

$FAB_014_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_01_00
He was against it.
$FAB_014_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_00
He supported the law.

He did not care.
$FAB_014_UNIQUE_QUESTION_02
Why did the defendant want Marat dead?
$FAB_014_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_02_00
Because the journalist kept writing slander about him.
$FAB_014_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_02_00
Marat threatened him first.
$FAB_014_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_02_01
Marat betrayed him.
$FAB_014_UNIQUE_QUESTION_03
