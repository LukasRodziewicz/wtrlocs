Denis Decoin is a 41-year-old writer and journalist from the <a name="1" class="hidden">impoverished aristocracy</a>, and is currently working as the editor-in-chief of the “Liberté!” journal. At first the paper was hugely popular among Parisians and radicals for pointing out the need for radical political and social changes. However, it recently underwent a <a name="3" class="hidden">reorientation</a> and the paper has started publishing articles that criticise the Revolutionary authorities.
$GEN_024_DOC_01_01
After Decoin published a piece about the Committee of Public Salvation, one of its representatives, Jean-Pierre-André Amar, accused him of having illegal sources of revenue and being engaged in hostile propaganda funded by the Counter-Revolutionaries.
$GEN_024_DOC_01_02
Decoin was allegedly writing articles that discredited the authorities of the Revolution commissioned by aristocrats who have left the country. The accused received this money through <a name="7" class="hidden">Madame Joan Casta</a>, who sells expensive dresses. Madame Casta testified to this during her own trial in front of Judge Amar, where she was accused of espionage. Witnesses also admitted that the journalist frequently visited Madame Casta under the pretext of buying something for his wife, and that they always met <a name="8" class="hidden">at the back of the store</a>.
$GEN_024_DOC_01_03
The investigators who searched Decoin’s house found a box hidden under the living room floor. Inside were <a name="9" class="hidden">7,000 francs</a>, corroborating Madame Casta’s statement.

<a name="10" class="hidden">Article</a> published in “Liberté!”:
Scandal in the Committee of Public Salvation! Is its president, Mr Amar, taking bribes for issuing certificates of civism?!

$GEN_024_OnStart_00
State your name, please.
$GEN_024_OnStart_01
I am Denis Decoin, editor-in-chief of the “Liberté!” journal and loyal Citizen of Paris.
$GEN_024_OnStart_02
Citizen Decoin, you are accused of spreading Counter-Revolutionary propaganda for your own financial benefit.
$GEN_024_OnStart_03
Those accusations stem from a plot conjured up against me because I have revealed the wrongs within the Committee of Public Salvation. The architect of this attack against independent journalism is none other than Jean-Pierre-André Amar, the representative of the Committee!
$GEN_024_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Denis Decoin to be guillotined! Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_024_OnGuilty_01
One less pest.
$GEN_024_OnGuilty_02
What if he was right?
$GEN_024_OnGuilty_03
That will teach them not to mess with people’s heads.
$GEN_024_OnNotGuilty_00
The judgement for Denis Decoin is… not guilty! Take the defendant away.
$GEN_024_OnNotGuilty_01
You believed the enemy of the Republic?
$GEN_024_OnNotGuilty_02
Can’t you see he’s a traitor?!
$GEN_024_OnNotGuilty_03
End him on the guillotine!
$GEN_024_04x11_00_QTitle
How much do you earn every month?
$GEN_024_04x11_00_00
How much do you earn every month?
$GEN_024_04x11_00_01
Lately, only about 300–400 francs. Unfortunately, the press is not as profitable as it once was. There’s been a decline in readership…
$GEN_024_04x11_00_02
With such a salary, how were you able to spend a total of 180 francs on dresses this month alone?
$GEN_024_04x11_00_03
I was pinching and scraping.
$GEN_024_04x11_00_04
On what? Bread or cheese? You do not look like a hungry fellow.
$GEN_024_04x11_00_05
And you spent those savings on superfluous clothing?
$GEN_024_04x11_00_06
There is nothing more important than my wife’s happiness.
$GEN_024_07x09_01_QTitle
What is the source of the money found in your house?
$GEN_024_07x09_01_00
What is the source of the money found in your house?
$GEN_024_07x09_01_01
It is my share of the inheritance from my late uncle, Roger Decoin.
$GEN_024_07x09_01_02
The evidence indicates that the accused received it from the Counter-Revolutionaries as payment for his articles criticising the current authorities.
$GEN_024_07x09_01_03
I inherited it! I am an independent journalist and I do not write at anyone’s request. And especially not at the request of Counter-Revolutionaries!
$GEN_024_07x09_01_04
Joan Casta does not agree.
$GEN_024_07x09_01_05
She probably reported me to distract you from her own misdeeds.
$GEN_024_07x09_01_06
Then why did you hide that money under the floor instead of depositing it in a bank, as any sane person would?
$GEN_024_07x09_01_07
I do not trust banks, and I hid the money to protect it from thieves.
$GEN_024_07x08_02_QTitle
Why were you meeting with Joan Casta at the back of her store?
$GEN_024_07x08_02_00
Why were you meeting with Joan Casta at the back of her store?
$GEN_024_07x08_02_01
We were working out details regarding my wife’s new dresses.
$GEN_024_07x08_02_02
Citizen Casta testified that it was then that she handed you the money to write libellous articles.
$GEN_024_07x08_02_03
Jean-Pierre-André Amar, the Judge who led her trial, forced her to testify this!
$GEN_024_07x08_02_04
Our judicial system does not resort to forceful methods of investigation.
$GEN_024_07x08_02_05
I will still take them into account. So you are not pleading guilty?
$GEN_024_07x08_02_06
Of taking money from Mrs Casta? Of course not, it was I who was paying her.
$GEN_024_07x08_02_07
You must admit that a man discussing the details of his wife’s dresses, instead of her doing so personally, is most unusual.
$GEN_024_07x08_02_08
I was paying for them.
$GEN_024_07x08_02_09
Maybe he wears them himself?
$GEN_024_05x10_03_QTitle
Who hired you to attack the representative of the Committee of Public Salvation?
$GEN_024_05x10_03_00
Who hired you to attack the representative of the Committee of Public Salvation?
$GEN_024_05x10_03_01
There was no commission. I found out that Amar had demanded a bribe from Fabiene Roelle for issuing him a certificate of civism, even though Roelle fully deserved it for being an active supporter of the Revolution.
$GEN_024_05x10_03_02
How did you learn this information?
$GEN_024_05x10_03_03
From Roelle. He came to the paper himself to tell that story.
$GEN_024_05x10_03_04
Can Citizen Roelle confirm your account?
$GEN_024_05x10_03_05
No. He refused to pay the bribe, so Amar did not issue his certificate. This led to Roelle's arrest and execution for being an enemy of the state. That’s how Amar operates!
$GEN_024_05x10_03_06
So, an enemy of the state who was facing trial came to you and asked you to smear a public official?
$GEN_024_05x10_03_07
That is not how I see it.
$GEN_024_05x10_03_08
What is your interpretation then?
$GEN_024_05x10_03_09
An honest, innocent man was desperately seeking help in his fight with a corrupt bureaucrat.
$GEN_024_02x03_04_QTitle
Why did “Liberté!” all of a sudden start criticising the authorities?
$GEN_024_02x03_04_00
Why did “Liberté!” all of a sudden start criticising the authorities? In the past, you wrote about them in glowing terms.
$GEN_024_02x03_04_01
There was no sudden change, I have only criticised them in justified cases. It is my duty as a journalist to inform people whenever the authorities are abusing their power.
$GEN_024_02x03_04_02
By justified, you mean paid for by political enemies of the Revolution?
$GEN_024_02x03_04_03
My readers are paying me, not politicians.
$GEN_024_05x07_05_QTitle
Was Joan Casta the one dictating to you the subjects of your slanderous articles…?
$GEN_024_05x07_05_00
Was Joan Casta the one dictating to you the subjects of your slanderous articles that attacked the authorities?
$GEN_024_05x07_05_01
This is ridiculous. Madame Casta was selling me dresses for my wife, that is all.
$GEN_024_05x07_05_02
Then who was really ordering them?
$GEN_024_05x07_05_03
The people of Paris who wish to know the truth.
$GEN_024_05x07_05_04
Speeches will not help you, but telling us the names of the culprits could.
$GEN_024_05x07_05_05
Nobody paid me for that article.
$GEN_024_01x09_06_QTitle
What would you do to recover the lost wealth of the Decoin family?
$GEN_024_01x09_06_00
What would you do to recover the lost wealth of the Decoin family?
$GEN_024_01x09_06_01
Whatever I could.
$GEN_024_01x09_06_02
So you would also take money from traitors and enemies of the people?
$GEN_024_01x09_06_03
Monsieur le juge, these are the methods of the Inquisition! I meant whatever I could legally do!
$GEN_024_01x09_06_04
What were you doing then?
$GEN_024_01x09_06_05
I was working relentlessly, that is what I was doing. Is that still not enough?
