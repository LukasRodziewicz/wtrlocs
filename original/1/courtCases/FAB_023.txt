We have him, monsieur le juge, we have Robespierre! Finally, we can try him for the terror he has brought upon us. For all the accusations of treason! For his dictatorial inclinations!
$FAB_023_DOC_01_01
At a time when the new government was full of corrupted people, he earned the nickname “the Incorruptible”. Nevertheless, France has paid a price in blood for his ideals. <a name="1" class="hidden">The Law of 22 Prairial</a>, which made it possible to sentence people without a trial, may have been proposed by Couthon, but it was the authority of Robespierre that led to its implementation. The defendant wanted to give himself the means to kill his political opponents, a perfect tool that would prevent them from testifying in court. When Robespierre pointed at someone, they were as good as dead.
$FAB_023_DOC_01_02
Moreover, according to a rumour, Robespierre allegedly suggested once while having dinner with Bertrand Barère that France could benefit by <a name="3" class="hidden">decimating its population</a>. That only a ruined and thinned out, but ideologically pure, society could rebuild France in the spirit of the Revolution.
$FAB_023_DOC_01_03
Why would Robespierre, a man whose reputation was once irreproachable, engage in such atrocities? Dictatorship, monsieur le juge, is our last accusation. We find no other logical explanation than the Incorruptible’s desire to gain <a name="4" class="hidden">absolute power</a> over France, which is equivalent to treason! After the defendant’s arrest, we searched the City Hall and found a seal <a name="5" class="hidden">engraved with the fleur-de-lis</a> – the main symbol of Royalist power.
$FAB_023_OnStart_00
First of all, I ask the accused if he is able to speak. Well?
$FAB_023_OnStart_01
I… can’t…
$FAB_023_OnStart_02
Monsieur le juge, everyone here demands that, in accordance with the law, we need only confirm the identity of the defendant and pass sentence without trial.
$FAB_023_OnStart_03
In accordance with the law, perhaps, but is it moral?
$FAB_023_OnStart_04
Let the Incorruptible taste the law he made for others!
$FAB_023_OnStart_05
Are you Maximilien Robespierre?
$FAB_023_OnStart_06
Yes…
$FAB_023_OnStart_07
We can now sentence him to death for his crimes against the people!
$FAB_023_OnGuilty_00
Guilty! And I will say it again – he is guilty! To the guillotine with him!
$FAB_023_OnGuilty_01
The end of tyranny!
$FAB_023_OnGuilty_02
Long live the Judge!
$FAB_023_OnNotGuilty_00
We cannot sentence this statesman. Set him free.
$FAB_023_OnNotGuilty_01
Thank you, thank you!
$FAB_023_OnNotGuilty_02
I do not wish to be in your shoes when the mob catches you.
$FAB_023_OnNotGuilty_03
The judge has conspired with this traitor!
$FAB_023_01x03_00_QTitle
Did you push through the Law of 22 Prairial in the Convention…?
$FAB_023_01x03_00_00
Did you push through the Law of 22 Prairial in the Convention to allow the mass murder of civilians?
$FAB_023_01x03_00_01
Hard to… talk…
$FAB_023_01x03_00_02
It’ll be even more difficult when they’ve cut your head off.
$FAB_023_01x03_00_03
Not to… murder…
$FAB_023_01x03_00_04
Then why this criminal and murderous law?
$FAB_023_01x03_00_05
For the good–
$FAB_023_01x03_00_06
If he says it’s for our good, I’ll take his head off myself!
$FAB_023_01x03_00_07
Of France. Not yours…
$FAB_023_02x04_01_QTitle
Did you long for absolute power?
$FAB_023_02x04_01_00
Did you long for absolute power?
$FAB_023_02x04_01_01
Never…
$FAB_023_02x04_01_02
And yet you are known for taking merciless measures against those who–
$FAB_023_02x04_01_03
Politics… like here. Politics…
$FAB_023_02x04_01_04
We are in the court now, and the court is ruled by Themis.
$FAB_023_02x04_01_05
Keep… the fools… thinking that.
$FAB_023_02x04_01_06
Give the bastard what he deserves!
$FAB_023_02x04_01_07
May I remind you that the defendant’s identity has been confirmed, and his guilt is obvious. He can be sentenced–
$FAB_023_02x04_01_08
I know the law, Prosecutor Tinville.
$FAB_023_02x04_01_09
Hurry… fainting…
$FAB_023_02x05_02_QTitle
Do you admit that you are guilty of treason and beheading politicians who were hostile to neighbouring countries?

Do you admit that you are guilty of treason and beheading politicians who were hostile to neighbouring countries?
$FAB_023_02x05_02_01
Never… no…
$FAB_023_02x05_02_02
I cannot look at this traitor.
$FAB_023_02x05_02_03
I only served France… the people.
$FAB_023_02x05_02_04
Then why do you have a seal with the fleur-de-lis?
$FAB_023_02x05_02_05
Forged… not mine…
$FAB_023_02x05_02_06
He’s trying to lie his way out of this!
$FAB_023_02x05_02_07
Which foreign ruler promised you the throne if you eliminated those politicians loyal to the Revolution?
$FAB_023_02x05_02_08
I removed… saboteurs. Like… you.
$FAB_023_02x05_02_09
We’ll remove your head!
$FAB_023_04x03_03_QTitle
Were the recent arrests a prelude to your “decimation of society”?

He’s the Devil himself!

Gossip… could never…
$FAB_023_04x03_03_03
What kind of man could think of something like that–
$FAB_023_04x03_03_04
A monster…
$FAB_023_04x03_03_05
To destroy the nation and make place for those who are loyal to him?
$FAB_023_04x03_03_06
It is beyond terrible.
$FAB_023_04x03_03_07
Not me…
$FAB_023_04x03_03_08
Tens of thousands have left their blood on your hands. It is not gossip – you sought to destroy the entire nation!
