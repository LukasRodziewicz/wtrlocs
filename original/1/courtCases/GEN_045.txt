	A cabriolet belonging to Marquis Leiningen fell off the Pont de la Tournelle and into the water. Luckily, there were no passengers in the back, and the carter managed to jump from the cart when it was still on the bridge. Only <a name="2" class="hidden">the horse</a> died, drowning in the Seine.
$GEN_045_DOC_01_01
	The Marquis called for compensation for the carriage and the horse from his coachman, Lucien Beaubois. Of course Beaubois did not have the required <a name="3" class="hidden">thousands of francs</a> and could not pay his debt. The Marquis filed a lawsuit against him, demanding that the coachman be sentenced to jail.
$GEN_045_DOC_01_02
	Citizen Beaubois claims that the incident was a result of a series of unfortunate events. First, let us quote, "all of a sudden, there was another cart on the bridge, hurtling at me like the devil." The defendant strongly pulled on the reins, startling the horse, which then turned to the side and started running straight at a crowd. Beaubois stated he pulled the reins further aside and the cart <a name="5" class="hidden">struck the railing</a> and fell into the water.
$GEN_045_DOC_01_03
	Beaubois has repeated numerous times that he <a name="6" class="hidden">broke his wrist</a> when jumping from the cart.

Please introduce yourself.
$GEN_045_OnStart_01
Lucien Beaubois. I’m a coachman.
$GEN_045_OnStart_02
How long have you been doing it?
$GEN_045_OnStart_03
Not long. I cared for the horses before and only started riding the cart over a year ago, on my nineteenth birthday. But I usually rode around the property, not in the city.
$GEN_045_OnStart_04
Marquis Leiningen demands compensation for the cart and the horse.
$GEN_045_OnStart_05
Sure he does. Now he only has four carts and thirty horses!
$GEN_045_OnStart_06
I would like to pay him back, but even with a good hand I couldn’t save that much money in years.
$GEN_045_OnStart_07
You should have thought about that on the bridge.
$GEN_045_OnGuilty_00
I find Marquis Leiningen’s demands reasonable. The defendant must pay with his head.
$GEN_045_OnGuilty_01
Indeed, people must pay for their mistakes.
$GEN_045_OnGuilty_02
With or without the Revolution, the bourgeoisie still have the courts in their pockets.
$GEN_045_OnNotGuilty_00
The accident on the bridge was only due to unfortunate circumstances. Citizen Beaubois, you are free to go.
$GEN_045_OnNotGuilty_01
The judge rubbed the snobbish aristocrat’s nose in the filth!
$GEN_045_OnNotGuilty_02
Poor thing will have to sell his silver spoons to buy a new cart.
$GEN_045_OnNotGuilty_03
Did you really believe him? Sooner or later we will see him here again, only next time it will be because he has run someone over.
$GEN_045_05x01_00_QTitle
How fast do you have to go to break through the bridge railing?
$GEN_045_05x01_00_00
How fast do you have to go to break through the bridge railing?
$GEN_045_05x01_00_01
I didn't break through it. The railing there is really short, sir, and Alcasse jumped over it. No wonder though, he was terrified. And with no luggage or passengers, the cabriolet was light and went over too.
$GEN_045_05x01_00_02
Why did you not try to stop the cabriolet?
$GEN_045_05x01_00_03
Now that you mention it, maybe I should have tried it, though I’m not sure I would have made a difference.
$GEN_045_05x01_00_04
He must have been going as fast as the wind!
$GEN_045_05x01_00_05
Was the carriage destroyed?
$GEN_045_05x01_00_06
I don’t know, sir. I just heard they managed to drag it out. Alcasse, too, but he was already dead, drowned on the spot.
$GEN_045_05x01_00_07
Did you hit any of the passers-by?
$GEN_045_05x01_00_08
No, thank God.
$GEN_045_04x02_01_QTitle
Why did you pull on the reins so sharply?
$GEN_045_04x02_01_00
Why did you pull on the reins so sharply?
$GEN_045_04x02_01_01
I saw another carriage coming from the opposite direction and panicked.
$GEN_045_04x02_01_02
You said that there were people on the bridge. How fast was the other carriage going?
$GEN_045_04x02_01_03
I think quite fast. The other coachman was whipping his horse… Yes, it must have been fast, because Alcasse got really scared.
$GEN_045_04x02_01_04
Could you have crashed into each other?
$GEN_045_04x02_01_05
I thought so, that’s why I pulled the reins, and then Alcasse went mad.
$GEN_045_04x02_01_06
It sounds like the horse did not trust you. Who let you ride?
$GEN_045_04x02_01_07
Well, one of the coachmen fell ill, the other was driving the Marquise… It just happened it had to be me.
$GEN_045_04x02_01_08
They let that youngster go out, and he immediately starts racing around.
$GEN_045_04x02_01_09
How long had you known that horse?
$GEN_045_04x02_01_10
I knew Alcasse a long time, but it was the first time I took him to the city. And look what happened…
$GEN_045_06x01_02_QTitle
Did you break your wrist when you jumped from the carriage?
$GEN_045_06x01_02_00
Did you break your wrist when you jumped from the carriage?
$GEN_045_06x01_02_01
Yes, sir, you can still see how swollen it is. It hurts all the time, and stops me sleeping.
$GEN_045_06x01_02_02
Was the Marquis interested in your health?
$GEN_045_06x01_02_03
He didn’t say anything to me. I mean… I haven’t seen him at all. His servant came to me, the one that’s responsible for his money affairs, and told me I have to pay the Marquis back.
$GEN_045_06x01_02_04
Which you did not do?
$GEN_045_06x01_02_05
Well, no, sir. Next time he came with the Guard.
$GEN_045_06x01_02_06
Can you drive a carriage with a broken wrist?
$GEN_045_06x01_02_07
What kind of question is that?!
$GEN_045_06x01_02_08
Sir, I wouldn’t even be able to slice bread if it weren’t for the help of my old mother.
$GEN_045_06x01_02_09
You could sell something to pay your debt.
$GEN_045_06x01_02_10
I could, but I wouldn’t get enough for a shirt or a wooden bowl.
$GEN_045_03x01_03_QTitle
How much money is Marquis Leiningen demanding for the cabriolet and the horse?
$GEN_045_03x01_03_00
How much money is Marquis Leiningen demanding for the cabriolet and the horse?
$GEN_045_03x01_03_01
I didn’t even try to remember, monsieur le juge. I couldn’t begin to imagine money like that.
$GEN_045_03x01_03_02
Could you ever save that much?
$GEN_045_03x01_03_03
Even with a good hand, I would have to work for ten years, probably more.
$GEN_045_03x01_03_04
What are you going to do?
$GEN_045_03x01_03_05
I don’t know, monsieur le juge. I would like to pay that debt, I really would, but I don’t know how I can… The Marquis sent his people to threaten me. They said I’d end up in the Seine like Alcasse, or in prison.
$GEN_045_03x01_03_06
Bastards! How can they threaten innocent people?!
$GEN_045_03x01_03_07
Are you creating this story to make yourself look like a victim?
$GEN_045_03x01_03_08
I wish I was, sir, but I’m terrified they really will throw me into the river.

$GEN_045_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_00_00
Another cart was coming from the opposite direction.

He heard a loud rumble.

A child ran in front of the horse.
$GEN_045_UNIQUE_QUESTION_01
Thugs from the Marquis threatened the defendant, saying that…
$GEN_045_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_01_00
They would throw him into the river.
$GEN_045_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_00
They would break his other arm.
$GEN_045_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_01
They would shoot him.
$GEN_045_UNIQUE_QUESTION_02
Was anyone hurt in the accident?
$GEN_045_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_02_00
Only the horse.
