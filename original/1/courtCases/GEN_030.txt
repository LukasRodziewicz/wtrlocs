René Mazeaud, 43 years old. A judge of one of the Parisian Tribunals. Before the Revolution, he was a trusted counsel for trade tycoons and the richest aristocratic families. After 1789, he became inspired by the ideals of the Revolution and was appointed as a judge.
$GEN_030_DOC_01_01
The people of Paris accused him of corruption and betrayal of the Revolution after he <a name="2" class="hidden">exculpated Adèle</a> de Maillard. She was accused of participating in her husband Emmanuel’s plot. Their conspiracy led to the murder of Gilbert Fuster, the popular chairman of the Revolutionary Committee.
$GEN_030_DOC_01_02
Adèle de Maillard’s guilt was proven by indisputable evidence. She lured the victim to her hunting lodge, where he was later killed by her husband. Nevertheless, Mazeaud, who was <a name="4" class="hidden">the Judge in Adèle’s case</a>, went to <a name="5" class="hidden">visit the accused in prison</a> during an adjournment of her trial that he himself ordered. Such visits, of course, are far from common. The judge was accompanied by Guard Roux. After that visit, Mazeaud resumed the trial and acquitted the defendant.
$GEN_030_DOC_01_03
The infuriated mob detained the Judge right after the verdict was announced. A quick search of his house revealed <a name="7" class="hidden">a document</a> proving that he had obtained financial gain from Adèle Maillard.
$GEN_030_DOC_01_04
The fact that prior to the Revolution Mazeaud was <a name="8" class="hidden">the lawyer of Joseph de Maillard</a>, Adèle’s father, only adds further intrigue to the case. Thanks to Mazeaud’s help, the old Maillard became rich exporting goods. With regards to Adèle de Maillard, she is currently <a name="9" class="hidden">missing</a>.
$GEN_030_DOC_02_00
<a name="10" class="hidden">Adèle de Maillard’s Last Will and Testament</a>:
$GEN_030_DOC_02_01
I, the undersigned Adèle de Maillard, being of sound mind, bequeath all the properties inherited by me from my father, Joseph de Maillard, to Citizen René Mazeaud. I declare that the aforementioned inheritance is part of my personal assets, thus they shall not be subject to any hereditary claims that could be made by my late husband Emmanuel’s heirs. Adèle de Maillard
$GEN_030_OnStart_00
What is your name?
$GEN_030_OnStart_01
René Mazeaud, monsieur le juge. I know the procedure very well. Could you move directly to the charges?
$GEN_030_OnStart_02
If the accused knows the procedure so well, he should know that it is I who makes the decisions, and not the defendant.
$GEN_030_OnStart_03
I beg your pardon, old habits…
$GEN_030_OnStart_04
René Mazeaud, you have been accused of accepting a bribe for freeing Adèle de Maillard, an enemy of the people and the Revolution. Can you explain yourself?
$GEN_030_OnStart_05
Citizen de Maillard was innocent. I investigated her case as a judge, and delivered the verdict. As far as my alleged bribery is concerned, this charge is not based on evidence or facts.
$GEN_030_OnStart_06
Let me remind you that we have de Maillard’s will.
$GEN_030_OnStart_07
That document is not related to the case, and I did not even know its content.
$GEN_030_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Citizen René Mazeaud to be guillotined! Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_030_OnGuilty_01
You have restored honour to your profession.
$GEN_030_OnGuilty_02
Wonderful!
$GEN_030_OnGuilty_03
As it should be!
$GEN_030_OnNotGuilty_00
The judgement for René Mazeaud is… not guilty! Lead the defendant away.
$GEN_030_OnNotGuilty_01
Treason!
$GEN_030_OnNotGuilty_02
Arrest the Judge!
$GEN_030_OnNotGuilty_03
I see. You would rather not set a precedent.
$GEN_030_02x03_00_QTitle
Why did you exculpate Adèle de Maillard if she helped her husband…?
$GEN_030_02x03_00_00
Why did you exculpate Adèle de Maillard if she helped her husband to kill Gilbert Fuster?
$GEN_030_02x03_00_01
There was no conclusive evidence of deliberate complicity by Citizen de Maillard.
$GEN_030_02x03_00_02
Nor was there any evidence that she tried to stop her husband from committing the murder.
$GEN_030_02x03_00_03
That is a completely different thing than deliberate complicity, is it not?
$GEN_030_02x03_00_04
The Law of Suspects does not differentiate between deliberate and involuntary complicity in crimes against the Revolution.
$GEN_030_02x03_00_05
It should not replace the Judge’s conscience and common sense. It is a decree regarding the suspects, not the convicted.
$GEN_030_01x10_01_QTitle
Was Adèle de Maillard’s will the price for her exculpation?
$GEN_030_01x10_01_00
Was Adèle de Maillard’s will the price for her exculpation?
$GEN_030_01x10_01_01
No, Citizen de Maillard drew it up discreetly of her own volition. I was unaware of its content.
$GEN_030_01x10_01_02
The defendant did not know its content even though it was in his possession? Interesting.
$GEN_030_01x10_01_03
The will was drawn up and sealed during my visit to the prison. Only then did Adèle de Maillard hand it to me and ask me to leave it with the notary Jules Costa.
$GEN_030_01x10_01_04
But the defendant was present when it was written out, so he had the opportunity to affect the content!
$GEN_030_01x10_01_05
Had I known the will's contents I would have sentenced Citizen de Maillard to be guillotined to inherit her assets. But I did not.
$GEN_030_01x10_01_06
Then why did she bequeath everything to you?
$GEN_030_01x10_01_07
I do not know that, and would rather not guess.
$GEN_030_01x10_01_08
How close were you to Adèle de Maillard?
$GEN_030_01x10_01_09
We knew each other, but were not close enough to be friends.
$GEN_030_08x10_02_QTitle
You worked for Adèle’s father, Joseph de Maillard, in the past.
$GEN_030_08x10_02_00
You worked for Adèle’s father, Joseph de Maillard, in the past. Could you assess his business and fortune?
$GEN_030_08x10_02_01
When our cooperation ended, Joseph de Maillard’s assets were earning him roughly 2 million francs, and I think they are still profitable today.
$GEN_030_08x10_02_02
So Adèle de Maillard would have quite a fortune.
$GEN_030_08x10_02_03
I know what you are implying, but I categorically deny persuading Citizen de Maillard to make me her inheritor.
$GEN_030_08x10_02_04
You are surprisingly well oriented in the Maillard’s financial situation.
$GEN_030_08x10_02_05
That is not surprising. I was their trusted counsel.
$GEN_030_08x10_02_06
With their money you would live like a king. It would seem to be a strong temptation.
$GEN_030_08x10_02_07
Would you succumb to it?
$GEN_030_08x10_02_08
Never.
$GEN_030_08x10_02_09
Precisely, and neither did I.
$GEN_030_05x06_03_QTitle
Call in the witness, Simon Roux.
$GEN_030_05x06_03_00
Call in the witness, Simon Roux.
$GEN_030_05x06_03_02
Please introduce yourself.
$GEN_030_05x06_03_03
Simon Roux, summoned here be monsieur le juge.
$GEN_030_08x09_04_QTitle
Did you know Adèle de Maillard?
$GEN_030_08x09_04_00
Did you know Adèle de Maillard?
$GEN_030_08x09_04_01
Prior to the Revolution, I conducted some of her father’s business. I assume that she could have known me.
$GEN_030_08x09_04_02
So she could have trusted you and, perhaps, counted on your mercy?
$GEN_030_08x09_04_03
It is possible, but I do not know. But there was no mercy when I gave the verdict.
$GEN_030_08x09_04_04
Really? You exculpated her in spite of strong evidence!
$GEN_030_08x09_04_05
It did not seem so strong at the time, but perhaps you know better.
$GEN_030_08x09_04_06
Of course he wouldn’t sentence his friend.
$GEN_030_04x05_05_QTitle
Why did you meet Adèle de Maillard in prison?
$GEN_030_04x05_05_00
Why did you meet Adèle de Maillard in prison? This is not something usually done during a trial.
$GEN_030_04x05_05_01
Citizen de Maillard fainted during the first day of the trial. I wanted to make sure that she was not pretending, and that I would be able to resume the trial as soon as possible.
$GEN_030_04x05_05_02
She could have planned that.
$GEN_030_04x05_05_03
I do not believe so. She felt quite ill.
$GEN_030_04x05_05_04
You could have waited for a doctor.
$GEN_030_04x05_05_05
And, as you know, I would have been waiting rather a long time. I also wanted to hasten things along as there was a long list of accused awaiting trial.
$GEN_030_09x10_06_QTitle
Are you responsible for Adèle de Maillard’s disappearance?
$GEN_030_09x10_06_00
Are you responsible for Adèle de Maillard’s disappearance?
$GEN_030_09x10_06_01
Of course not, I had nothing to do with that.
$GEN_030_09x10_06_02
The disappearance of Citizen de Maillard does look rather convenient for you, especially considering the content of her will.
$GEN_030_09x10_06_03
I wonder whether you killed or simply hid her to get the money sooner?
$GEN_030_09x10_06_04
Once again, I do not know Citizen de Maillard’s location, nor had I anything to do with her disappearance. I do not know whether she is alive or dead.
$GEN_030_07x10_07_QTitle
Where did you get the will?
$GEN_030_07x10_07_00
Where did you get the will?
$GEN_030_07x10_07_01
Citizen de Maillard handed it to me when I visited her in prison and asked me to give it to a notary. There is nothing illegal about that.
$GEN_030_07x10_07_02
She did so during the adjournment of her trial?
$GEN_030_07x10_07_03
Indeed.
$GEN_030_07x10_07_04
Why did she wait that long?
$GEN_030_07x10_07_05
I do not know. You would have to find her and ask her yourself.
$GEN_030_WIT_00_A_QTitle
How many times did you visit Adèle de Maillard in prison?
$GEN_030_WIT_00_A_00
How many times did you visit Adèle de Maillard in prison?
$GEN_030_WIT_00_A_01
Only once, Citizen Judge, during her trial.
$GEN_030_WIT_00_A_02
Was the accused as interested in all the detainees?
$GEN_030_WIT_00_A_03
As far as I remember, Judge Mazeaud didn’t meet any other detainee. But I was ordered not to interfere with him.
$GEN_030_WIT_01_A_QTitle
Could you describe Mazeaud’s visit with the former detainee?
$GEN_030_WIT_01_A_00
Could you describe Mazeaud’s visit with the former detainee?
$GEN_030_WIT_01_A_01
It was calm at first, then at some point they started shouting at each other. Then they were calm again.
$GEN_030_WIT_01_A_02
Could you say who shouted what?
$GEN_030_WIT_01_A_03
Judge Mazeaud said that something was inappropriate and against the rules, and he wouldn’t do it. I didn’t understand the detainee’s words, she was mumbling.
$GEN_030_WIT_01_A_04
Do you think they could have been arguing because de Maillard attempted to bribe him with a share in her inheritance?
$GEN_030_WIT_01_A_05
That’s rather obvious.
$GEN_030_WIT_01_A_06
I think so. The judge had a bag containing writing materials with him.
$GEN_030_WIT_01_A_07
So he planned it!
$GEN_030_WIT_01_A_09
What say you to those allegations?
$GEN_030_WIT_01_A_10
It is my opinion they prove that I never demanded any gratuity for exculpating the defendant.
$GEN_030_WIT_01_A_11
But you could have agreed on such a proposal, even if you were reluctant at first.
$GEN_030_WIT_01_A_12
The only thing I was reluctant of was undertaking the delivery of her will to a notary.
$GEN_030_WIT_01_B_QTitle
Did you know the purpose of the Judge’s visit to the prison?
$GEN_030_WIT_01_B_00
Did you know the purpose of the Judge’s visit to the prison?
$GEN_030_WIT_01_B_01
Yes, there was an official note claiming that Judge Mazeaud wanted to check on the defendant’s health.
$GEN_030_WIT_01_B_02
And he did?
$GEN_030_WIT_01_B_03
What was there to check? Consumption, Citizen Judge, and it was bad. She didn’t have much time left. And there was one more thing…
$GEN_030_WIT_01_B_04
What?!
$GEN_030_WIT_01_B_05
Before the trial, we performed a thorough medical examination of the defendant and found that she was pregnant. It hadn’t been for long, but her belly was already getting bigger. Somehow no one else had noticed it.
$GEN_030_WIT_01_B_06
She abandoned her assets to give birth. It is as simple as that.
$GEN_030_WIT_01_B_07
Whose child could it be?
$GEN_030_WIT_01_B_08
I don’t know for sure, but I heard rumours about Gilbert Fuster.
$GEN_030_WIT_01_B_10
What say you to those allegations?
$GEN_030_WIT_01_B_11
I think that we have heard enough to understand why sending Citizen de Maillard to the guillotine, as the people wanted, would have been barbaric. Even if there was conclusive evidence of her guilt.
$GEN_030_WIT_01_B_12
We can also understand how much you stood to profit as the sole inheritor of Adèle de Maillard’s wealth.
$GEN_030_WIT_01_B_13
I would have to wait for her death and that of her unborn child. Anyone who dares call themselves a human being would find this despicable.

$GEN_030_UNIQUE_QUESTION_00
How did Mazeaud justify the exculpation of Maillard?
$GEN_030_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_00_00
A lack of evidence.
$GEN_030_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_00_00
The testimonies given by the witnesses.
$GEN_030_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_00_01
An intervention made by his superiors.
$GEN_030_UNIQUE_QUESTION_01
According to the Judge himself, why did he go to the defendant’s cell?
$GEN_030_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_01_00
He was worried about her health.
$GEN_030_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_00
He wanted to question her.
$GEN_030_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_01
He was looking for evidence.
$GEN_030_UNIQUE_QUESTION_02
Who was the defendant to the acquitted woman?
$GEN_030_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_02_00
Her father’s lawyer.
$GEN_030_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_02_00
Her former servant.
$GEN_030_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_02_01
Her bastard half-brother.
