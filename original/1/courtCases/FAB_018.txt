The accused sitting here today is Jacques Hébert. You probably know him best for his publications in his periodical “Le Père Duchesne”, in which he tracked and criticised the misdeeds of politicians, aristocrats, and the clergy. Today, he himself is the one accused of embezzling public money, treason, and calling on the people to riot.
$FAB_018_DOC_01_01
We all know the stories that tell of the poverty Hébert lived in before the Revolution. Now his property has grown unnaturally quickly, proven by his <a name="2" class="hidden">sumptuous way of living</a>. We were unable to determine the source of his illegal profits, but Citizen Robespierre exerted pressure on us, as you very well know.
$FAB_018_DOC_01_02
Next are the accusations of treason and inciting the masses to rebellion. On this matter, evidence was easier to gather. Robespierre paid close attention to Hébert’s newspaper because of the latter’s uncompromising attacks on deputies of the Convention. He accused them of corruption, treason, and even murder, but the language used suggested that his sources were mostly gossip and speculations, masked by the <a name="4" class="hidden">vulgar form</a> he used to make his writings attractive to imbeciles. The defendant has many times underlined that his articles present the point of view and stance of the Paris Commune, which as we know is dominated by people unable to read and write fluently. It is therefore more probable that in this way he manipulated them to achieve his own ends. He fuelled their agitation to keep in check those who could turn against him. We know very well what the mob is capable of if encouraged. The people of the Commune <a name="5" class="hidden">have also been restless</a> for some time, since life in Paris has now become peaceful and quiet under the rule of law and it is no longer necessary to catch incidental passers-by and put their heads on pikes.
$FAB_018_DOC_01_03
The recent acts of Hébert, who together with Danton has thrown down the gauntlet to Robespierre, seems to confirm that the defendant’s pugnacity has a <a name="6" class="hidden">political taint</a> to it. If that is so, we have to ask ourselves why he is willing to sacrifice the good of France for his own private interests, and why he attacks a great statesman like Robespierre. This explains <a name="7" class="hidden">the accusation of treason</a>.
$FAB_018_OnStart_00
Introduce yourself, Citizen.
$FAB_018_OnStart_01
What nerve, you traitor!
$FAB_018_OnStart_02
Refrain from that attitude immediately!
$FAB_018_OnStart_03
I want everyone to know that I, Jacques Hébert, have been betrayed!
$FAB_018_OnStart_04
At least now we have your personal information…
$FAB_018_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Citizen Hébert to be guillotined!
$FAB_018_OnGuilty_01
I hope the rest of your allies remember how easily you can betray others…
$FAB_018_OnGuilty_02
To the guillotine with the traitor!
$FAB_018_OnGuilty_03
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!
$FAB_018_OnNotGuilty_00
Hébert is innocent, I see no evidence of his crimes.
$FAB_018_OnNotGuilty_01
Reason has won!
$FAB_018_OnNotGuilty_02
Robespierre will kill us for this…
$FAB_018_OnNotGuilty_03
They’re in it together, acquitting one another like that.
$FAB_018_01x04_00_QTitle
What was the reason behind the writing style of your articles in “Le Père Duchesne”?
$FAB_018_01x04_00_00
What was the reason behind the writing style of your articles in “Le Père Duchesne”?
$FAB_018_01x04_00_01
You have to shock people to make them think and act, and that is what I tried to do. I never deceived my readers – everyone knew my style of writing.
$FAB_018_01x04_00_02
But perhaps you deceived your conscience, which probably called for temperance and not unjustly harming people!
$FAB_018_01x04_00_03
My conscience is cleaner than yours, otherwise I would not be standing here! Each and every one of you deserves an elaborate article!
$FAB_018_01x04_00_04
I expect it would be as vulgar as the rest of them!
$FAB_018_01x04_00_05
But the people would turn against you with all their might and ruthlessness. The city would be clear within one hour. Again.
$FAB_018_01x04_00_06
He’s right!
$FAB_018_01x04_00_07
We know how it’s done, don’t we, François!
$FAB_018_01x05_01_QTitle
France is accusing you of using your newspaper to incite riots. What do you have to say to that?
$FAB_018_01x05_01_00
France is accusing you of using your newspaper to incite riots. What do you have to say to that?
$FAB_018_01x05_01_01
It is criminals who are accusing me, not France.
$FAB_018_01x05_01_02
You are flattering yourself, Hébert. Excessively, I may add.
$FAB_018_01x05_01_03
France could not have accused me, because I am France’s favourite son. The only one who has yet to give up on his ideals, the only one who has not fallen under the burden of demand. The only one who–
$FAB_018_01x05_01_04
Be silent. We have all had quite enough of your propaganda.
$FAB_018_01x05_01_05
If there are riots, it is because of venal traitors, and not those who reveal the truth.
$FAB_018_01x05_01_06
As long as they reveal what is actually true, and not their own embellished version of events.
$FAB_018_01x05_01_07
It is what we call the free communication of ideas and opinions, and nobody can take that privilege away from us!
$FAB_018_02x07_02_QTitle
Where did you get the money for such a sumptuous lifestyle?
$FAB_018_02x07_02_00
Where did you get the money for such a sumptuous lifestyle?
$FAB_018_02x07_02_01
Sumptuous?! People need only compare it with the times of my poverty for it to make such an impression on them.
$FAB_018_02x07_02_02
A clever excuse, but you both dress and eat better than the common folk, and are often seen in the company of dignitaries.
$FAB_018_02x07_02_03
Was not the purpose of the Revolution to let the poor live with dignity? And I used to be extremely poor once.
$FAB_018_02x07_02_04
Citizen Robespierre has accused you of either stealing the money or receiving it from foreign powers.
$FAB_018_02x07_02_05
And where is Robespierre, I ask? Sitting in City Hall, surrounded by his cut-throats and lackeys, terrorising the city! He really does throw around the most idiotic accusations!
$FAB_018_02x07_02_06
But you admit that you once embezzled public money, which you stole when you worked in a theatre.
$FAB_018_02x07_02_07
My penance for that has long since been done. I have been converted and put the sins of my youth behind me.
$FAB_018_03x04_03_QTitle
Do you not think that the style of your articles was far from in line with the dignity of the Convention?
$FAB_018_03x04_03_00
Do you not think that the style of your articles was far from in line with the dignity of the Convention?
$FAB_018_03x04_03_01
Well, the dignity of the Convention depends on the honesty of its deputies, including myself.
$FAB_018_03x04_03_02
Citizen Robespierre has accused you of corrupting politicians, as articles in “Le Père Duchesne” were published whenever a risk of exposure emerged.
$FAB_018_03x04_03_03
What kind of nonsense is that?
$FAB_018_03x04_03_04
When anyone tried to delve deeper into an issue, you published an article to exclude yourself from the circle of suspects!
$FAB_018_03x04_03_05
Do you deny doing that?
$FAB_018_03x04_03_06
Of course… I never… This is just ridiculous! Anyone who loves France will never believe in my guilt!
$FAB_018_03x06_04_QTitle
It has been suspected that your attacks have been inspired by political issues, and not the best interests of the nation.
$FAB_018_03x06_04_00
It has been suspected that your attacks have been inspired by political issues, and not the best interests of the nation.
$FAB_018_03x06_04_01
Politics is a filthy game, but I still do not have that stink upon me.
$FAB_018_03x06_04_02
What do you mean?
$FAB_018_03x06_04_03
I never cared about political positions. It was the good of the Citizens that was of utmost importance to me.
$FAB_018_03x06_04_04
And you never envied Robespierre his position or the respect the people give him?
$FAB_018_03x06_04_05
No, because he does not deserve it. I have worked for it, earned it!
$FAB_018_03x06_04_06
But he will be the one mentioned in the history books, Hébert, not you.
$FAB_018_03x06_04_07
…
$FAB_018_03x06_04_08
Does the accused have a comment to that remark?
$FAB_018_03x06_04_09
Robespierre has no talent and is little more than a worm! I am the one who deserves recognition, and I get it – the people are on my side!
$FAB_018_03x06_04_10
But they will not follow you to the guillotine.
$FAB_018_04x05_05_QTitle
What type of people make up the majority of readers for your newspaper?
$FAB_018_04x05_05_00
What type of people make up the majority of readers for your newspaper?
$FAB_018_04x05_05_01
They are mostly those who are disregarded, overlooked – the poor, the half-illiterate, those who carry the Revolution on their shoulders.
$FAB_018_04x05_05_02
So your articles were aimed at those who are easily manipulated?
$FAB_018_04x05_05_03
I write for people whose minds are not filled with lies spoken by traitors, those who have not been trapped in the tangled webs of deceit and promised favours.
$FAB_018_04x05_05_04
Those who, if required, could be roused to fight against the Convention?
$FAB_018_04x05_05_05
The honesty and openness that I present in my articles raises me above any suspicions of subversive activity. My readers know me well.
$FAB_018_04x05_05_06
Although, did you not lose a case of slander at one time, Hébert?
$FAB_018_04x05_05_07
That was a long time ago.
$FAB_018_07x06_06_QTitle
Which country gave you the order to incite the people?
$FAB_018_07x06_06_00
Which country gave you the order to incite the people?
$FAB_018_07x06_06_01
None, I only serve France.
$FAB_018_07x06_06_02
But an open attack on Robespierre, when people are dying of hunger in the streets, can hardly be interpreted as serving your country.
$FAB_018_07x06_06_03
It is because of Robespierre that they are dying of hunger! Besides, you joined me in this attack!
$FAB_018_07x06_06_04
For the good of France.
$FAB_018_07x06_06_05
You see! Villainous rascals! You all sing the same song as me when somebody pushes you. If I am guilty, you are no more than the beastly sons of the Devil himself!
