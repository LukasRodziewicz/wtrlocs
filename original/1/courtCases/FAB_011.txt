The accused who will now stand before us is Jean-Nicolas Pache, the Mayor of Paris, suspected of treason through <a name="1" class="hidden">cooperation with hostile powers</a>.
$FAB_011_DOC_01_01
He was arrested following the written testimony of Béatrice Caron, daughter of a local cooper, but best known for her connections with the rotten Muscadins. The girl admitted to being an Austrian spy, and declared that she obtained information from the defendant himself. Thanks to her knowledge, she was allegedly able to disrupt the everyday lives of Parisians. In exchange for revealing her informant in the city authorities, Caron was expelled from France under the penalty of death should she return.
$FAB_011_DOC_01_02
The investigation, which I carried out together with Prosecutor Tinville, indicates that Citizen Pache was following the orders of Caron’s Austrian employers, and the girl was responsible for exchanging letters between the two. We were unable to find solid evidence for many of the mayor’s suspicious acts, but one aspect of the investigation is clear – the delayed construction of the Pont de la Révolution. Enemy forces wished to prevent it, as the structure was to <a name="4" class="hidden">unite the French</a>, to become a symbol of the rekindled Revolutionary flame. The plotters could also hope to <a name="5" class="hidden">bring shame upon Robespierre himself</a> as the originator and supporter of this undertaking.
$FAB_011_DOC_01_03
The evidence of this conspiracy was discovered in <a name="6" class="hidden">letters</a> that we confiscated during a search of the defendant’s office. All of them were signed only with a “D”, and we have not been able to ascertain the identity of this mysterious person. We have rejected the most popular suggestion – that it is Danton – as it is common knowledge that he and Robespierre are political allies, as well as friends.

Letter
$FAB_011_DOC_02_00
	For J.-N. P. 
	The gentlemen of the mason’s guild are not willing to listen to our arguments and have suspended their work on the bridge. They will have to be convinced by force. Do it, Pache – Robespierre will give in, and you will get your payment. 
	D.
$FAB_011_OnStart_00
For the sake of protocol, please introduce yourself.
$FAB_011_OnStart_01
My name is Jean-Nicolas Pache and I am the Mayor of Paris. I would like to announce that the accusations against me are the result of a conspiracy by this judge!
$FAB_011_OnStart_02
You have taken a bold approach, traitor.
$FAB_011_OnStart_03
We will soon find out who the traitor is. Ask your questions, Fidèle!
$FAB_011_OnGuilty_00
I sentence the defendant to death. Get him out!
$FAB_011_OnGuilty_01
Justice!
$FAB_011_OnGuilty_02
That’s what happens to traitors!
$FAB_011_OnGuilty_03
I will meet you in hell, Fidèle!
$FAB_011_OnPrison_00
[To jest mock i należy go zmienić!!!!]
$FAB_011_OnNotGuilty_00
The defendant is innocent. Take him out of my sight.
$FAB_011_OnNotGuilty_01
This is a scandal!
$FAB_011_01x02_00_QTitle
Do you admit to having cooperated with a foreign power?
$FAB_011_01x02_00_00
Do you admit to having cooperated with a foreign power?
$FAB_011_01x02_00_01
No, I do not. It was you who came up with this plot, Fidèle!
$FAB_011_01x02_00_02
I would ask the defendant to behave with at least some dignity.
$FAB_011_01x02_00_03
Has the mayor been drinking today? Did anybody give him wine?
$FAB_011_01x02_00_04
What did you receive in exchange for spying?
$FAB_011_01x02_00_05
I was not given anything, because I am not a spy! The judge has conjured up the crazy idea that I was behind the attempt on his life, and he is taking revenge!
$FAB_011_01x02_00_06
What kind of nonsense is this?
$FAB_011_01x02_00_07
I have proof. The testimony of–
$FAB_011_01x02_00_08
And where is the person who signed this dubious document?
$FAB_011_01x02_00_09
This Citizen has fled–
$FAB_011_01x02_00_10
What? You killed her? So you’re not only traitors, but murderers as well!
$FAB_011_01x02_00_11
What’s he talking about?
$FAB_011_01x05_01_QTitle
Did our enemies wish to bring discredit upon Robespierre?
$FAB_011_01x05_01_00
Did our enemies wish to bring discredit upon Robespierre?
$FAB_011_01x05_01_01
I have no idea what they could have wanted. Besides, it would be completely irrational to use me for such a deed.
$FAB_011_01x05_01_02
Why?
$FAB_011_01x05_01_03
Because I had very little power. The only connection between me and Robespierre was the damn bridge, and as far as I know this was only one of their many initiatives.
$FAB_011_01x05_01_04
That does not prove a thing.
$FAB_011_01x05_01_05
It makes sense.
$FAB_011_01x05_01_06
If they had wished to discredit Robespierre, they would have looked for someone closer to him.
$FAB_011_01x05_01_07
That argument is not entirely convincing.
$FAB_011_01x05_01_08
Neither are your ridiculous accusations! Why not find a link between me and Pontius Pilate? You are just speculating.
$FAB_011_03x04_02_QTitle
Do you realise how much harm you caused the Revolution…
$FAB_011_03x04_02_00
Do you realise how much harm you caused the Revolution due to the complications with the bridge?
$FAB_011_03x04_02_01
It is quite the opposite, as the bridge would have been built anyway. I was very much aware of the importance this structure held, and I personally supervised the project to ensure the professional conduct of the construction workers and–
$FAB_011_03x04_02_02
Wait a minute! The professional conduct of the construction workers? You must be joking! How can you refer to the construction’s sabotage and the attempt to break the Revolutionary spirit of the French in such a manner?
$FAB_011_03x04_02_03
Please spare me this political agitation. I know it by heart.
$FAB_011_03x04_02_04
Perhaps he didn’t have ill intentions?
$FAB_011_03x04_02_05
Shut your mouth and listen to your betters!
$FAB_011_03x04_02_06
To me, the most important matter was to make sure the bridge is safe. But the symbolism is just as important, and why I wanted to prevent it from collapsing due to improper construction. Now that would have been a symbolic catastrophe! That is the real reason why there have been so many inspections and stoppages.
$FAB_011_03x04_02_07
It’s good that he took care of it.
$FAB_011_07x06_04_QTitle
Did you receive all your orders through letters?
$FAB_011_07x06_04_00
Did you receive all your orders through letters?
$FAB_011_07x06_04_01
Stop this slander. If there is a traitor here, he is sitting before me, pretending to be a righteous judge!
$FAB_011_07x06_04_02
I will not tolerate this much longer! Testify, or go straight to the guillotine!
$FAB_011_07x06_04_03
I testify that I have always served France, and no other country!
$FAB_011_07x06_04_04
Then where are the orders in these letters from?
$FAB_011_07x06_04_05
I have seen no letters. Do you really think that I would have kept such obvious proof of my guilt if I were a traitor?!
$FAB_011_07x06_04_06
The defendant is obviously a fool, as well as a traitor.
$FAB_011_07x06_04_07
And you are even greater fools if you cannot see that someone is creating evidence and conspiring against me!

$FAB_011_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_04_01
He believes to be the victim of a scheme by neighbouring countries wishing to weaken France.
$FAB_011_PLOT_TWIST_GUARD_01_01
Citizen Fidèle, you have to… There is something you need to see.
$FAB_011_PLOT_TWIST_JUDGE_01_02
You scumbag! My child!
$FAB_011_PLOT_TWIST_MENTOR_01_02
Alexis, try to calm yourself.
$FAB_011_PLOT_TWIST_TINVILLE_01_03
Citizen Fidèle… We heard about your tragedy. Is there anything we–
$FAB_011_PLOT_TWIST_JUDGE_01_04
All of you, shut the hell up! Pache, why did you kill my boy?!
$FAB_011_PLOT_TWIST_PASHE_01_05
I know nothing about child-killing – that is more your style.
$FAB_011_PLOT_TWIST_JUDGE_02_QTitle
Why did you do it, Pache?
$FAB_011_PLOT_TWIST_JUDGE_02_01
Why did you do it, Pache?
$FAB_011_PLOT_TWIST_PASHE_02_02
I do not know what I am being accused of now.
$FAB_011_PLOT_TWIST_JUDGE_02_03
Of killing my child!
$FAB_011_PLOT_TWIST_PASHE_02_04
I was in a cell all this time. Where did you get the idea I could kill someone outside it? Lies and humbug.
$FAB_011_PLOT_TWIST_TINVILLE_02_05
You could have paid someone to commit the murder. Your indictment shows that you are capable of it!
$FAB_011_PLOT_TWIST_JUDGE_03_QTitle
Who killed my son, Pache?
$FAB_011_PLOT_TWIST_JUDGE_03_01
Who killed my son, Pache?
$FAB_011_PLOT_TWIST_PASHE_03_02
Probably those who you so treacherously attack, just as you attacked me. You accuse without evidence, you slander. So you got a response. I have more honour than that, and that is why I am here, defending myself in person.
$FAB_011_PLOT_TWIST_JUDGE_03_03
Who is behind this? Tell me immediately or you will go straight to the scaffold!
$FAB_011_PLOT_TWIST_PASHE_03_04
See? The Judge is threatening me with the guillotine for his own gain. This is not a trial, this is a farce!
$FAB_011_PLOT_TWIST_TINVILLE_03_05
Quiet, child-killer!
