In the dock is Étienne Lebeau, a brawler and degenerate resident of Paris, and frequent client of sordid public houses in Faubourg-de-Gloire. Last month, together with his comrade Michel Verdière, he <a name="2" class="hidden">attacked another drinking partner</a>, Jean Boudon.
$GEN_004_DOC_1_01
A witness who saw everything claims that Lebeau and Verdière ambushed their victim when he was returning to the attic where he used to sleep. They attacked Boudon in a dark alley, battered him, took his money, and then <a name="3" class="hidden">stabbed him</a>.
$GEN_004_DOC_1_02
Soon afterwards, Verdière was detained. During routine questioning he admitted to participating in the assault. Even though he swore that it was Lebeau who pushed the knife into Boudon, Verdière was sentenced to be guillotined.
$GEN_004_DOC_1_03
Meanwhile, Lebeau vanished into thin air. Apparently he holed up in Neuilly. Upon his arrest, the rogue recited what we have already heard, swearing that Verdière was responsible for stabbing Boudon. Lebeau had with him <a name="4" class="hidden">an elegant pouch</a> that was almost empty. It surely did not belong to him.
$GEN_004_DOC_1_04
Evidence: <a name="5" class="hidden">A knife taken from Lebeau.</a>

You’ll lose your head, scum!
$GEN_004_OnStart_01
I'm Étienne.
$GEN_004_OnStart_02
I did not allow the accused to speak yet.
$GEN_004_OnStart_03
I don't care.
$GEN_004_OnStart_04
You shall treat the members of the Court with respect!
$GEN_004_OnStart_05
Mhm, with the most respect. Of course.
$GEN_004_OnStart_06
Considering the behaviour of the accused, I think I already know the verdict.
$GEN_004_OnStart_07
Death!
$GEN_004_OnStart_08
Behead him!
$GEN_004_OnStart_09
The guillotine!
$GEN_004_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Citizen Étienne Lebeau to death by guillotine!
$GEN_004_OnGuilty_01
Congratulations on a just verdict.
$GEN_004_OnGuilty_02
Huzzah!
$GEN_004_OnGuilty_03
That rascal had it coming.
$GEN_004_OnPrison_00
I sentence Citizen Étienne Lebeau to prison! Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_004_OnPrison_01
I demand the verdict be changed!
$GEN_004_OnPrison_02
The judge has a soft heart for criminals.
$GEN_004_OnPrison_03
At least he won’t be a threat to anyone else.
$GEN_004_OnNotGuilty_00
The verdict in the case of Citizen Boudon’s murder is… not guilty! Mr Lebeau is free to go.
$GEN_004_OnNotGuilty_01
Please let it be written that I officially protest.
$GEN_004_OnNotGuilty_02
He let the rogue go!
$GEN_004_OnNotGuilty_03
Murderer or not, that wretch should rot in prison!
$GEN_004_01x02_00_QTitle
Do you admit to assaulting Citizen Boudon?
$GEN_004_01x02_00_00
Do you admit to assaulting Citizen Boudon?
$GEN_004_01x02_00_01
Well, there’s no use lyin’ when everyone knows it. Yeah, me and Verdière ambushed ’im–
$GEN_004_01x02_00_02
To kill him?
$GEN_004_01x02_00_03
To rob ’im! Nothin’ more! I didn’t think Verdière would kill ’im!
$GEN_004_01x02_00_04
Murderer!
$GEN_004_01x02_00_05
But you did not stop him, did you?
$GEN_004_01x02_00_06
What am I, the National Guard? He’d have cut me as well!
$GEN_004_01x02_00_07
He deserves to be rotting underground!
$GEN_004_02x04_01_QTitle
When the Guard searched you, they found an embroidered pouch. Where did you get it?
$GEN_004_02x04_01_00
When the Guard searched you, they found an embroidered pouch. Where did you get it?
$GEN_004_02x04_01_01
From 'im. Boudon.
$GEN_004_02x04_01_02
You searched his pockets while he was bleeding to death in the street?!
$GEN_004_02x04_01_03
No! I battered ’im so he couldn’t stand, took ’is pouch, and turned round to run. That’s when Verdière stabbed ’im.
$GEN_004_02x04_01_04
You kept hitting him until he lost consciousness?
$GEN_004_02x04_01_05
How else would I rob ’im?
$GEN_004_02x04_01_06
You could have killed him doing that anyway.
$GEN_004_02x04_01_07
But I didn’t. Just robbed ’im.
$GEN_004_02x04_01_08
He's lying!
$GEN_004_02x04_01_09
You killed him, thug!
$GEN_004_02x04_01_10
Why would he do that? You had already taken his money.
$GEN_004_02x04_01_11
You shouldn’t’ve chopped off ’is head. Can’t ask ’im now, can you?
$GEN_004_03x05_02_QTitle
A bloodstained pocket-knife was found at the crime scene.
$GEN_004_03x05_02_00
A bloodstained pocket-knife was found at the crime scene. Did you use it to stab Citizen Boudon?
$GEN_004_03x05_02_01
No! The Guards took me knife.
$GEN_004_03x05_02_02
Why did you have a knife with you?
$GEN_004_03x05_02_03
Because he’s a murderer!
$GEN_004_03x05_02_04
Because of… y’know… stuff. Sometimes it comes in handy.
$GEN_004_03x05_02_05
For example, when the need arises to stab a fellow Citizen?
$GEN_004_03x05_02_06
I didn’t stab ’im, understand? Not with me knife, not with anyone’s knife! If I wanted to slaughter ’im, I’d do it with me bare hands!
$GEN_004_03x05_02_07
I wonder how many he’s already slaughtered?
$GEN_004_02x03_03_QTitle
So you still claim that it was Verdière who murdered Citizen Boudon?
$GEN_004_02x03_03_00
So you still claim that it was Verdière who murdered Citizen Boudon?
$GEN_004_02x03_03_01
Yes.
$GEN_004_02x03_03_02
The lying rat!
$GEN_004_02x03_03_03
But it was you who battered and robbed him.
$GEN_004_02x03_03_04
It was ’is idea to rob Boudon ’cos they’d argued about somethin’. When I took his pouch, it weren’t that full.
$GEN_004_02x03_03_05
Why would Verdière ask you to join him? If he had assaulted Boudon alone, he could have kept all the money for himself.
$GEN_004_02x03_03_06
Err… Well… Maybe he was scared to go alone?
$GEN_004_02x03_03_07
A professional criminal scared to rob a man alone?
$GEN_004_02x03_03_08
You should’ve asked Verdière before you offed ’im. I weren’t in ’is head, you know?
$GEN_004_02x03_03_09
He joined in himself to get a share!
$GEN_004_01x03_04_QTitle
Where did you first meet the victim?
$GEN_004_01x03_04_00
Where did you first meet the victim?
$GEN_004_01x03_04_01
Y’know, we were drinkin’ together for a few months. Bit of a strange bird, that fella. He painted some things, kind of a merchant too. Always had money and happy to buy the next round.
$GEN_004_01x03_04_02
And you killed such a great companion without scruples?
$GEN_004_01x03_04_03
How many times do I have to say it? I didn’t kill nobody! Anyway, everyone knew Verdière was a beast.
$GEN_004_01x03_04_04
You knew that as well and, nonetheless, decided to join him?
$GEN_004_01x03_04_05
The accomplice of a beast is an animal as well!
$GEN_004_01x03_04_06
Verdière claimed during his trial that it was you who had blood on his hands.
$GEN_004_01x03_04_07
A guilty man always tries to blame someone else.
