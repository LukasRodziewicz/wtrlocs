The Marquis de Favras is a 46-year-old aristocrat, <a name="1" class="hidden">former soldier</a>, and currently a political activist <a name="2" class="hidden">sympathising with the monarchy</a>. After he left the army, he married and started travelling across Europe with his <a name="3" class="hidden">wife</a>. During that journey, he both fulfilled himself politically, and <a name="4" class="hidden">supported</a> his wife. He returned to Paris in 1789 and took part in <a name="6" class="hidden">a conspiracy</a> that was supposed to put an end to the Revolution. De Favras showed poor judgement when he decided to confide in his former comrades, who betrayed him and informed the authorities of the plan.
$GEN_011_DOC_01_01
De Favras is suspected of playing a huge part in Citizen Capet’s escape from France. The plotters asked him to take out a loan of <a name="7" class="hidden">2 million francs</a>, which would have covered all the expenses of Citizen Capet and his family on their way out of France.
$GEN_011_DOC_01_02
If everything had gone according to plan, 30,000 soldiers would have entered the capital city with orders to kill three political leaders: Finance Minister Jacques Necker, the Mayor of Paris Jean Sylvain Bailly, and Commander-in-Chief of the Parisian National Guard, François Hanriot. The next step was to block food supplies from entering the city.
$GEN_011_DOC_01_03
De Favras and his wife have been detained and accused of plotting against the people of France and the Revolution, and will likely be sentenced to the guillotine. The Count of Provence has denied having any connections with them.

$GEN_011_DOC_2_MAIN
De Favras, where are your troops? From what direction will they enter Paris? I should like to be employed among them.
$GEN_011_OnStart_00
Please introduce yourself.
$GEN_011_OnStart_01
I am Thomas de Mahy, Marquis de Favras.
$GEN_011_OnStart_02
Marquis de Favras, you have been accused of taking an active part in a plot against the people of France.
$GEN_011_OnStart_03
I fail to understand how any of the deeds I am accused of would harm the people of France.
$GEN_011_OnStart_04
You wanted to re-establish the fallen monarchy that brought us exploitation, hunger, and misery.
$GEN_011_OnStart_05
That's right!
$GEN_011_OnStart_06
We have strong evidence, testimonies of your officers, clearly showing that you wanted to abolish the Revolution.
$GEN_011_OnStart_07
Please, tell me everything about that strong evidence you have against me.
$GEN_011_OnStart_08
How brazen!
$GEN_011_OnGuilty_00
Thomas de Mahy, Marquis de Favras, you are sentenced to death! Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_011_OnGuilty_01
One head at a time.
$GEN_011_OnGuilty_02
A just verdict!
$GEN_011_OnGuilty_03
That’s what happens to enemies of the Revolution!
$GEN_011_OnPrison_00
I sentence Thomas de Mahy, Marquis de Favras, to prison! Take him away.
$GEN_011_OnPrison_01
No, no, no! Enemies of the Revolution should be beheaded!
$GEN_011_OnPrison_02
The Judge has lost his mind!
$GEN_011_OnNotGuilty_00
The judgement for Thomas de Mahy, Marquis de Favras is… not guilty! Take the defendant away.
$GEN_011_OnNotGuilty_01
No, no, no! Enemies of the Revolution should be beheaded!
$GEN_011_OnNotGuilty_02
The Judge is an enemy of the Revolution!
$GEN_011_OnNotGuilty_03
We won’t forget this!
$GEN_011_06x07_00_QTitle
Why did you want to withdraw 2 million francs? This is an enormous amount of money.
$GEN_011_06x07_00_00
Why did you want to withdraw 2 million francs? This is an enormous amount of money.
$GEN_011_06x07_00_01
I withdrew it at the request of my superior, the Count of Provence. As for its intended purpose, I would not dare to ask.
$GEN_011_06x07_00_02
How can you borrow so much money for another person and not even question its purpose?
$GEN_011_06x07_00_03
An obvious lie. That information would be required to get such a loan!
$GEN_011_06x07_00_04
We aristocrats treat each other with respect and discretion. You would not understand.
$GEN_011_06x07_00_05
Mockery!
$GEN_011_06x07_00_06
Two of your officers testified that the money would be used to aid Citizen Capet and his family in their escape from France. Why did you tell them that?
$GEN_011_06x07_00_07
You should ask what the reason for their testimony is. I agree, there is a plot. But one against me, and not the Revolution.
$GEN_011_06x07_00_08
That traitor is trying to talk his way out of it!
$GEN_011_02x09_01_QTitle
What is your relationship with the Count of Provence, the brother of Citizen Capet…?
$GEN_011_02x09_01_00
What is your relationship with the Count of Provence, the brother of Citizen Capet, Louis Stanislas Xavier de Bourbon?
$GEN_011_02x09_01_01
I was a lieutenant in the Swiss Guard in the Count’s service.
$GEN_011_02x09_01_02
So the Count trusts you?
$GEN_011_02x09_01_03
At the risk of sounding immodest, I deserve to be trusted and respected.
$GEN_011_02x09_01_04
The people of France would likely not confirm your words, since you were plotting against them.
$GEN_011_02x09_01_05
Those are just your presumptions.
$GEN_011_02x09_01_06
They’re enough to behead you, worm!
$GEN_011_02x09_01_07
Calm down!
$GEN_011_08x10_02_QTitle
Who is the mysterious M. de Foucault who wrote you the letter…?
$GEN_011_08x10_02_00
Who is the mysterious M. de Foucault who wrote you the letter concerning your troops?
$GEN_011_08x10_02_01
I do not know that person. Anyone could write a letter to me, and make up the contents regarding any matter they saw fit.
$GEN_011_08x10_02_02
Did that random letter from an unknown person not concern you?
$GEN_011_08x10_02_03
It is gibberish.
$GEN_011_08x10_02_04
An honest Citizen would have shown it to the authorities.
$GEN_011_08x10_02_05
It never occurred to me. I do not have the slightest inkling what that person was writing about.
$GEN_011_08x10_02_06
Not about the troops that were supposed to enter Paris and end the Revolution after the successful rescue of Citizen Capet?
$GEN_011_08x10_02_07
There are no troops currently under my command. That letter, and the accusation of me sending troops to Paris, are both serious misunderstandings.
$GEN_011_08x10_02_08
Who else then? He’s a dog on the Bourbons’ leash!
$GEN_011_08x10_02_09
Tell me, would 2 million francs be enough to hire 30,000 foot soldiers?
$GEN_011_08x10_02_10
It would be more than enough.
$GEN_011_01x02_03_QTitle
What do you think about the Revolution?
$GEN_011_01x02_03_00
What do you think about the Revolution?
$GEN_011_01x02_03_01
Everyone knows that the state desperately needed reforms, but the violence? An unexpected and brutal assault on the Royal Family should be called revenge, not a revolution.
$GEN_011_01x02_03_02
So you are against the Revolution, yes?
$GEN_011_01x02_03_03
I am merely disappointed by its course. As a former soldier, I can tell you that violence and war will always result in more hatred and more violence.
$GEN_011_01x02_03_04
Yet you were still preparing to forcefully capture the city?
$GEN_011_01x02_03_05
That has not been proven.
$GEN_011_01x02_03_06
If they hadn’t caught him, the streets of Paris would be covered in blood!
$GEN_011_01x02_03_07
Nonsense! What are you people talking about?
$GEN_011_01x02_03_08
Calm down! Marquis de Favras, your attitude towards the Revolution makes you a traitor to the state in the eyes of the people.
$GEN_011_01x02_03_09
I am saddened to hear that a few words of hard truth are enough to call someone a traitor and sentence him to death.
$GEN_011_03x05_04_QTitle
What countries did you and your wife visit during your trip across Europe?
$GEN_011_03x05_04_00
What countries did you and your wife visit during your trip across Europe?
$GEN_011_03x05_04_01
Poland, or what was left of it, Austria, Hungary…
$GEN_011_03x05_04_02
What made you choose those countries? Were you trying to make Catholic alliances for Citizen Capet?
$GEN_011_03x05_04_03
We were looking for charming sceneries and good food.
$GEN_011_03x05_04_04
Who did you meet during your missions?
$GEN_011_03x05_04_05
What missions? We had conversations with hundreds of people, and I will not list all of them here.
$GEN_011_03x05_04_06
Of course not, he’s no snitch.
$GEN_011_03x04_05_QTitle
What is your wife’s profession?
$GEN_011_03x04_05_00
What is your wife’s profession?
$GEN_011_03x04_05_01
She is not doing anything in particular at the moment. Back in Austria, her home, she had attempted to involve herself in politics.
$GEN_011_03x04_05_02
With what results?
$GEN_011_03x04_05_03
Mediocre, obviously, since we decided to return to France.
$GEN_011_03x04_05_04
There is nothing obvious about that. You could have been successful and returned as spies for an enemy state.
$GEN_011_03x04_05_05
You may interpret it however you wish, especially if you enjoy bedtime stories.
$GEN_011_01x03_06_QTitle
Why did you end your military career?
$GEN_011_01x03_06_00
Why did you end your military career?
$GEN_011_01x03_06_01
I married. That was the only reason.
$GEN_011_01x03_06_02
Many military men have wives and it does not seem to be a problem for them.
$GEN_011_01x03_06_03
My wife was scared for my life, and she convinced me that I had already done enough for my country.
$GEN_011_01x03_06_04
Yeah, serving Capet and his cronies.
$GEN_011_06x09_07_QTitle
Call in the witness, Louis de Bourbon.
$GEN_011_06x09_07_00
Call in the witness, Louis de Bourbon.
$GEN_011_06x09_07_02
Please introduce yourself.
$GEN_011_06x09_07_03
My name is Louis Stanislas Xavier de Bourbon. I am the Count of Provence and brother to Louis Capet.
$GEN_011_06x09_07_04
There you have it, the traitor’s brother!
$GEN_011_WIT_00_A_QTitle
Describe your relationship with your brother prior to his death.
$GEN_011_WIT_00_A_00
Describe your relationship with your brother prior to his death.
$GEN_011_WIT_00_A_01
When it came to current events in France we did not agree, so our relationship had become distant.
$GEN_011_WIT_00_A_02
Are you saying that you had different views on the Revolution?
$GEN_011_WIT_00_A_03
Yes, I think the Revolution was necessary.
$GEN_011_WIT_00_A_04
Why did you not intervene when your brother’s life was in danger?
$GEN_011_WIT_00_A_05
I tried to convince him to step down and accept the Revolution. He was too stubborn to listen and paid the price.
$GEN_011_WIT_00_B_QTitle
What do you know about the plot involving the Marquis de Favras?
$GEN_011_WIT_00_B_00
What do you know about the plot involving the Marquis de Favras?
$GEN_011_WIT_00_B_01
The bankers Schaumel and Sartorius informed me that the Marquis was negotiating a loan of 2 million francs.
$GEN_011_WIT_00_B_02
Did they tell you the reason behind this loan?
$GEN_011_WIT_00_B_03
They did not, and I did not ask. I am not one to pry.
$GEN_011_WIT_00_B_04
Were you somehow involved?
$GEN_011_WIT_00_B_05
I learned about the loan only because Schaumel and Sartorius are my close friends. Allow me to repeat what I have already told the Paris Commune: I was not involved in the Marquis de Favras's plot. If you find him guilty, then he should be sentenced to prevent him from harming the Revolution that I wholeheartedly agree with.

$GEN_011_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_01_00
He sympathises with the movement but not with its methods.
$GEN_011_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_00
He does not support it.
$GEN_011_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_01
He wholeheartedly supports it.
$GEN_011_UNIQUE_QUESTION_02
What were the 2 million francs spent on?
$GEN_011_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_02_00
On the expenses of Citizen Capet during his escape.
$GEN_011_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_02_00
It bought the benevolence of the King of Spain.
$GEN_011_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_02_01
It bought the support of the Duke of York.
