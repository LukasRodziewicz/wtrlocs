The defendant is… This is hard to believe, but it is my duty to continue. The defendant is the former President of the Revolutionary Tribunal, Raymond Dévoyé. He is allegedly guilty of causing the <a name="1" class="hidden">death of Judge Alexis Fidèle’s son</a>. The child’s body was <a name="2" class="hidden">found hanging</a> at the Pont de la Révolution.
$FAB_016_DOC_1_01
Yesterday afternoon, we received an <a name="3" class="hidden">anonymous letter</a> informing us that the boy’s murderer was hiding in the residence of Raymond Dévoyé. After we arrived, we found the defendant alone, his behaviour clearly indicating he was <a name="4" class="hidden">deeply inebriated</a>. When we asked him about the content of the letter, he burst into tears, wailing, “He was guilty,” and kept asking, “Is Frédéric alive?” At one point, he <a name="6" class="hidden">threw a carafe</a> full of wine against the wall. On his way to prison, he kept yelling, “Forgive me.”
$FAB_016_DOC_1_02
On the day following his arrest in his prison cell, the defendant refused to repeat his confession of the previous evening. Instead, Citizen Dévoyé demanded to be placed before a judge of the Tribunal so that he could explain the entire affair.
$FAB_016_DOC_1_03
I was not familiar with the defendant’s family situation, therefore I decided to look into it. He was living alone, as <a name="7" class="hidden">his wife died</a> several years ago, with the doctor saying it was a problem with her heart. Gossip says that she was exhausted by the defendant’s regular abuse of alcohol. Their only son <a name="8" class="hidden">joined the army</a> as soon as he came of age, and nobody has seen him in Paris since. The neighbours say both father and son were aggressive towards each other, and often heard yelling coming from the house as <a name="9" class="hidden">the two men quarrelled</a>.
$FAB_016_OnStart_00
I would like to start by addressing the Judge–
$FAB_016_OnStart_01
How dare you speak!
$FAB_016_OnStart_02
Listen to me, please, I have so much to–
$FAB_016_OnStart_03
You will be able to confess everything during the trial. We have no regard for murderers!
$FAB_016_OnStart_04
That’s right!
$FAB_016_OnStart_05
After all these years… You would do something like this to me?
$FAB_016_OnStart_06
It is not like that–
$FAB_016_OnStart_07
Shut up, child killer!
$FAB_016_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Raymond Dévoyé to be guillotined! Get that bastard out of my sight.
$FAB_016_OnGuilty_01
Very well.
$FAB_016_OnGuilty_02
Let the child killer rot!
$FAB_016_OnNotGuilty_00
I find Raymond Dévoyé innocent…
$FAB_016_OnNotGuilty_01
This judge has no respect for his own family.
$FAB_016_OnNotGuilty_02
I cannot begin to understand why your heart has suddenly decided to soften.
$FAB_016_01x02_00_QTitle
Were you personally involved in the hanging of Frédéric Fidèle?
$FAB_016_01x02_00_00
Were you personally involved in the hanging of Frédéric Fidèle?
$FAB_016_01x02_00_01
No, Alexis, I never–
$FAB_016_01x02_00_02
You will address the Judge as “monsieur le juge”, and not by his first name.
$FAB_016_01x02_00_03
The wretch is taking liberties.
$FAB_016_01x02_00_04
I did not kill the son of… monsieur le juge. How could I? You were my only family…
$FAB_016_01x02_00_05
Do not even dare to suggest such a thing.
$FAB_016_01x02_00_06
I will say it again – I did not kill him. How could I kill a boy whom I had known since his birth?
$FAB_016_01x02_00_07
This makes the whole affair even more disgusting.
$FAB_016_01x02_00_08
All I did was pass on information. I did not murder him!
$FAB_016_01x03_01_QTitle
It would appear your companions decided to give you up.
$FAB_016_01x03_01_00
It would appear your companions decided to give you up. The anonymous denunciation we received that led to your arrest must surely have been sent by your accomplices.
$FAB_016_01x03_01_01
I do not know, I… A man approached me who needed information concerning the family of monsieur le juge. It was only information.
$FAB_016_01x03_01_02
And you simply gave it to him and suspected nothing?
$FAB_016_01x03_01_03
Well, he did offer something in exchange…
$FAB_016_01x03_01_04
So he bribed you?
$FAB_016_01x03_01_05
They have my son! He was arrested for trying to abandon the Army, and there is only one punishment for desertion.
$FAB_016_01x03_01_06
And this man promised they would drag him out in exchange for help?
$FAB_016_01x03_01_07
It is my son. I used to drink a lot, and failed to realise the importance of family. Now, I drink because I lost it, and these people took advantage of that. They assured me that if I refused to help them, my son would be put before a firing squad.
$FAB_016_01x03_01_08
Who was the man that came to you?
$FAB_016_01x03_01_09
I did not learn his real name, but he knew both Judge Fidèle and me. His right arm had been amputated at the elbow.
$FAB_016_01x05_02_QTitle
Why did you do this? Why? Answer me!
$FAB_016_01x05_02_00
Why did you do this? Why? Answer me!
$FAB_016_01x05_02_01
The man who came to me promised to return what was left of my family.
$FAB_016_01x05_02_02
So you traded one life for another?
$FAB_016_01x05_02_03
I could not have known what this man would do with the information. He only said they needed to find out who they were dealing with. They wanted to know anything about Alexis Fidèle…
$FAB_016_01x05_02_04
And you believed them?
$FAB_016_01x05_02_05
Yes, because I desperately wanted to get my son back… I was stupid, but I did not kill your son.
$FAB_016_01x05_02_06
You did, and you are as guilty as the man that came to you. What was his name?
$FAB_016_01x05_02_07
I am sorry, truly, I do not know. Please forgive me, I beg you, monsieur le juge. I would never have intentionally hurt your family.
$FAB_016_01x05_02_08
It makes no difference. Blood must be repaid with blood!
$FAB_016_01x05_02_09
Well said!
$FAB_016_02x04_03_QTitle
What were you doing the day the body was found?
$FAB_016_02x04_03_00
What were you doing the day the body was found?
$FAB_016_02x04_03_01
There was a trial and then–
$FAB_016_02x04_03_02
We remember. What happened later?
$FAB_016_02x04_03_03
From what had happened, I realised that… I understood that I had unwillingly caused a tragedy. Had I known what they would use that information for…
$FAB_016_02x04_03_04
That is unimportant. You deserve the same punishment as any murderer.
$FAB_016_02x04_03_05
No, no! I really… I cannot… You are like family. Frédéric’s death is as painful to me as it is to you!
$FAB_016_02x04_03_06
Do not even dare…!
$FAB_016_02x04_03_07
It is the truth! Since then, there has not been a day I would not drink… I was last like this when I lost my son, when he went to serve at the front. I was sure I would never see him again–
$FAB_016_02x04_03_08
Enough of this sentimental prattling. You are a murderer, plain and simple.
$FAB_016_02x04_03_09
Murderer!
$FAB_016_02x04_03_10
No… I was tricked.
$FAB_016_04x05_04_QTitle
How much had you drunk on the day of your arrest?
$FAB_016_04x05_04_00
How much had you drunk on the day of your arrest?
$FAB_016_04x05_04_01
Enough to forget.
$FAB_016_04x05_04_02
About what?
$FAB_016_04x05_04_03
That I have caused those I love to suffer.
$FAB_016_04x05_04_04
Tell that to my wife, and she will kill you with her bare hands.
$FAB_016_04x05_04_05
I know that she will hate me.
$FAB_016_04x05_04_06
All of Paris hates you!
$FAB_016_04x05_04_07
Child killer!
$FAB_016_04x05_04_08
I did not want that. Please, believe me…
$FAB_016_04x05_04_09
You should already know how many times we have heard that in this court!
$FAB_016_04x06_05_QTitle
Did you intend to hurt the Guards who came to arrest you?
$FAB_016_04x06_05_00
Did you intend to hurt the Guards who came to arrest you?
$FAB_016_04x06_05_01
Of course not! I am not sure I even remember what I was thinking then.
$FAB_016_04x06_05_02
Then how do you know that you did not want to hurt them?
$FAB_016_04x06_05_03
Because I am not like that.
$FAB_016_04x06_05_04
Of course not, no.
$FAB_016_04x07_06_QTitle
The investigators say that your wife’s death may be associated with your tendency to…
$FAB_016_04x07_06_00
The investigators say that your wife’s death may be associated with your tendency to abuse alcohol.
$FAB_016_04x07_06_01
I expect they are right.
$FAB_016_04x07_06_02
Please make it clear what you mean.
$FAB_016_04x07_06_03
I was drinking for a long time. Rather more for pleasure than any other reason. My wife… she could hardly stand it, nor could my son. Only now can I see how bad it was.
$FAB_016_04x07_06_04
You mean her heart could not stand it?
$FAB_016_04x07_06_05
I would be happy if information that I gave monsieur le juge about my wife privately in his home was not talked about here…
$FAB_016_04x07_06_06
It is now a matter of the court, and what you want is of no importance here.
$FAB_016_04x07_06_07
I see… Well, perhaps my conduct did contribute to her untimely death, but I did not do it–
$FAB_016_04x07_06_08
On purpose? Yes, we know already that you kill others by accident.
$FAB_016_06x09_07_QTitle
Your neighbours say they overheard many quarrels between you and your son.
$FAB_016_06x09_07_00
Your neighbours say they overheard many quarrels between you and your son.
$FAB_016_06x09_07_01
I will not deny it. We often had outbursts in the past, and I regret it now.
$FAB_016_06x09_07_02
What were they about?
$FAB_016_06x09_07_03
Life in general, me, but usually everything that was bad about me. Anything that a son could accuse his father of after a wife has cried about her drunkard of a husband.
$FAB_016_08x09_08_QTitle
Was your son’s decision to join the army in any way connected to your quarrels?
$FAB_016_08x09_08_00
Was your son’s decision to join the army in any way connected to your quarrels?
$FAB_016_08x09_08_01
Yes, it was. As soon as my son could make the decision independently and lawfully, he did.
$FAB_016_08x09_08_02
Have you seen him since?
$FAB_016_08x09_08_03
No. The first news I received about him since was of his attempted desertion.
