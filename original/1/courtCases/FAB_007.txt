Jean-Marie Roland, until recently a minister of the interior, has been accused of <a name="1" class="hidden">corruption</a> and <a name="2" class="hidden">treason</a>.
$FAB_007_DOC_1_01
For the charge of corruption, we began the investigation by questioning prominent members of the Convention. Citizens Hébert and Robespierre were particularly helpful. They testified that Minister Roland had, several times, discreetly offered them benefits for softening their stance with regards to the continuation of war against the monarchies that pose a threat to us, chiefly Britain and Spain. The Citizens mentioned had no hard evidence that would allow them to accuse Roland. Furthermore, they suspected the offer did not come directly from the minister. They speculated that the originator could have been <a name="4" class="hidden">Citizen Capet</a> himself, who maintained strong relations with Roland. Not wanting to make a false accusation, the people involved were waiting for indisputable evidence to emerge.
$FAB_007_DOC_1_02
 When his attempt to bribe prominent Convention members failed, Roland supposedly turned to less influential deputies. He hoped to win their hearts with the support of his wife, Jeanne Marie Roland. She hosted a political salon, which served as a cover for managing a <a name="6" class="hidden">brothel</a>. Unfortunately, we were not able to identify any deputies who could have taken advantage of the hospitality offered by Madame Roland and her charges. Nevertheless, the local residents confirmed that coaches full of men used to arrive at night to the given address. We do not know whether they really went there to discuss politics, but it does not seem probable.
$FAB_007_DOC_1_03
	The charge of treason is based on the matter disclosed during the trial of Citizen Capet, i.e. the iron cabinet. Roland supposedly <a name="7" class="hidden">hurried to take</a> some of the documents from the cabinet that could give him away. One of the participants of those events and the minister’s subordinate, Phillipe Côté, has expressed his readiness to testify. Thanks to his ready wits, the <a name="8" class="hidden">destruction of documents</a> concerning Louis himself was prevented.
$FAB_007_DOC_1_04
As if this were not enough, at the very last moment, Citizen Saint-Just reported that in order to rise to full power, the Girondins were attempting to <a name="9" class="hidden">overthrow the Convention</a> by force. We have been notified that members of this group worked actively to <a name="10" class="hidden">incite an uprising</a>, which would allow them to take power in other parts of the country. Supposedly, the cities of Nantes and Niort were under serious threat of their activity, as the intensity of <a name="11" class="hidden">Counter-Revolutionary</a> and Monarchist moods has intensified.
$FAB_007_DOC_1_05
In the light of these facts, the people of Paris, represented by Prosecutor Tinville, ask for this traitor to be sentenced to death immediately!
$FAB_007_OnStart_00
Although we all know the defendant, please introduce yourself for the record.
$FAB_007_OnStart_01
Jean-Marie Roland, Minister of the Interior and Deputy of the Convention–
$FAB_007_OnStart_02
You are no longer a minister, you traitor!
$FAB_007_OnStart_03
I am innocent, unless you are able to prove my guilt.
$FAB_007_OnStart_04
Cut the serpent’s head off as fast as you can!
$FAB_007_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Jean-Marie Roland to death! Let him die like the other traitors!
$FAB_007_OnGuilty_01
Good! Long live the Judge!
$FAB_007_OnGuilty_02
Let’s rid the government of English spies!
$FAB_007_OnPrison_00
Jean-Marie Roland is sentenced to prison.
$FAB_007_OnPrison_01
Are you not taking this case too lightly?
$FAB_007_OnPrison_02
Bullshit! Do you expect us to accept this?
$FAB_007_OnNotGuilty_00
Jean-Marie Roland is innocent. Let him go.
$FAB_007_OnNotGuilty_01
Innocent?
$FAB_007_OnNotGuilty_02
Maybe the Judge is a traitor too?!
$FAB_007_OnNotGuilty_03
They clearly did not stab you hard enough, did they?
$FAB_007_01x03_00_QTitle
Citizens Hébert and Robespierre testified that you offered them a bribe…
$FAB_007_01x03_00_00
Citizens Hébert and Robespierre testified that you offered them a bribe for softening the course of our foreign policy. Is that true?
$FAB_007_01x03_00_01
Of course not. As the Minister of the Interior, it would have been of no benefit to me.
$FAB_007_01x03_00_02
That depends on what Citizen Capet expected of you.
$FAB_007_01x03_00_03
If I had talked the Convention into peace negotiations, the people would think it was all over. They would be thrown off guard and enemy agents would slip through the borders more easily. This would have added considerable difficulty to my work.
$FAB_007_01x03_00_04
The defendant is instead suggesting the possible motive for his actions. That is exactly what a traitor would want, a greater number of enemy spies destroying France!
$FAB_007_01x03_00_05
Traitor!
$FAB_007_01x03_00_06
More spies would mean more money from the Austrians!
$FAB_007_01x03_00_07
Be quiet, you cacophonous dolt! Thanks to my work, the Hébertists were able to carry on with their wars, without worrying about the country falling apart beneath their authoritarian boots!
$FAB_007_01x03_00_08
Silence!
$FAB_007_01x06_01_QTitle
The investigators’ findings suggest that the defendant’s wife had a luxury brothel…
$FAB_007_01x06_01_00
The investigators' findings suggest that the defendant's wife had a luxury brothel, in which the corruption of Convention members could have taken place.
$FAB_007_01x06_01_01
That is complete nonsense, and an insult! My wife is a respected woman of virtue who hosted a political salon. It was a place for great minds to meet and exchange their views on current affairs…
$FAB_007_01x06_01_02
My informants have confirmed the findings of the investigators.
$FAB_007_01x06_01_03
What a deceitful bastard this Roland is!
$FAB_007_01x06_01_04
What do I care about a few fools? If my wife had truly organised such orgies in the middle of Paris, you would not need secret informants to learn of it. This accusation is pure absurdity.
$FAB_007_01x06_01_05
So you have not bribed any politicians by offering these… services?
$FAB_007_01x06_01_06
None. Besides, whom would I bribe and why? I have not a single enemy in politics.
$FAB_007_01x06_01_07
The majority of the Convention wish for your death by the guillotine, so maybe you should open your eyes and pay more attention. According to my information, this form of bribery was already responsible for winning you the support of Jean Debry and Brissot.
$FAB_007_01x06_01_08
That is nothing more than gossip, and offensive to those statesmen!
$FAB_007_02x04_02_QTitle
Do you remember, Citizen, that Louis Capet was found guilty of treason?
$FAB_007_02x04_02_00
Do you remember, Citizen, that Louis Capet was found guilty of treason?
$FAB_007_02x04_02_01
I do, of course.
$FAB_007_02x04_02_02
It would appear the proposals of corruption were the idea of the deceased.
$FAB_007_02x04_02_03
There were no proposals, and if Louis considered something like this, I know nothing of it.
$FAB_007_02x04_02_04
You are referring to him by his first name? Citizen Capet himself spoke warmly of you, mentioning your special relationship and cooperation.
$FAB_007_02x04_02_05
Lou… Citizen Capet was my superior – and that was indeed the nature of our relationship.
$FAB_007_02x04_02_06
People in the corridors often said you could hardly let go of Capet’s hand because you were kissing it so often.
$FAB_007_02x04_02_07
Why not just say he’d have happily sodomised the man!
$FAB_007_02x04_02_08
I do not wish to offend the court.
$FAB_007_02x04_02_09
This is not a court trial, but a scandal!
$FAB_007_02x07_03_QTitle
Call Phillipe Côté to the court.
$FAB_007_02x07_03_00
Call Phillipe Côté to the court.
$FAB_007_02x07_03_02
Please introduce yourself.
$FAB_007_02x07_03_03
I am Phillipe Côté, I work, or rather, I used to work, for Minister Roland.
$FAB_007_02x07_03_04
Can you state your position?
$FAB_007_02x07_03_05
Not really, I just carried out assorted duties for the minister. Putting documents in order, delivering messages, giving bribes…
$FAB_007_02x07_03_06
What’s he talking about?
$FAB_007_02x07_03_07
He is revealing the minister’s true face.
$FAB_007_02x07_03_08
Initially, I was unaware they were bribes. I only came to understand their meaning later.
$FAB_007_02x08_04_QTitle
You are accused of intending to destroy evidence against Citizen Capet.
$FAB_007_02x08_04_00
You are accused of intending to destroy evidence against Citizen Capet.
$FAB_007_02x08_04_01
That is foolishness and a matter of fiction. Do not believe a thing that rotten Côté has said – he was not inside my head to read my thoughts or intentions!
$FAB_007_02x08_04_02
But he knew you rather well…
$FAB_007_02x08_04_03
He was weak and too easily influenced, and now he seeks to avenge himself like a stray cat who dreams of being a lion. After all, the documents were submitted to the court, were they not?
$FAB_007_02x08_04_04
They were, but only because you had no luck and Citizen Côté returned too quickly. You did not expect it and you became clumsy!
$FAB_007_02x08_04_05
And he’s lying to us so boldly!
$FAB_007_02x08_04_06
How do you know that I did not intend to hand them over?
$FAB_007_02x09_05_QTitle
I would like to return to one incident now which is not in the files.
$FAB_007_02x09_05_00
I would like to return to one incident now that is not in the files. Do you recall how you visited me after the trial of Citizen Capet?
$FAB_007_02x09_05_01
I do…
$FAB_007_02x09_05_02
And do you also remember how you foretold my forthcoming doom, including a suggestion of my imminent death?
$FAB_007_02x09_05_03
What a shameless rat!
$FAB_007_02x09_05_04
I would like to point out that I was in a state of agitation…
$FAB_007_02x09_05_05
He threatened the Judge with death?
$FAB_007_02x09_05_06
And, strangely enough, it was not even a few days later that I was attacked in the street by strangers who stabbed me in the stomach!
$FAB_007_02x09_05_07
I knew you were a despicable wretch, but I never suspected you were a murderer as well.
$FAB_007_02x09_05_08
I refuse to answer.
$FAB_007_02x09_05_09
Was this also a part of the plan to overthrow the Convention? To kill the Judge who could send you to the guillotine?!
$FAB_007_02x09_05_10
I refuse to answer. I am innocent!
$FAB_007_04x05_06_QTitle
Did your wife also remain in contact with Citizen Capet?
$FAB_007_04x05_06_00
Did your wife also remain in contact with Citizen Capet?
$FAB_007_04x05_06_01
She attended one or two of his banquets with me…
$FAB_007_04x05_06_02
No traitor can ever stop themselves from consorting with aristocratic asses.
$FAB_007_04x05_06_03
I would appreciate it if Prosecutor Tinville could hold his tongue.
$FAB_007_04x05_06_04
Apart from these circumstances, my wife had no contact with Citizen Capet – she had no reason to talk to him.
$FAB_007_04x05_06_05
Are you certain you know exactly what was happening in her brothel?
$FAB_007_04x05_06_06
That’s a good one!
$FAB_007_04x05_06_07
My wife is a decent woman!
$FAB_007_04x05_06_08
That’s even better!
$FAB_007_04x11_07_QTitle
There is evidence that Girondin activity in certain parts of the country…
$FAB_007_04x11_07_00
There is evidence that Girondin activity in certain parts of the country has boosted Counter-Revolutionary attitudes.
$FAB_007_04x11_07_01
What do I have to do with that?
$FAB_007_04x11_07_02
You have been recognised as the central figure in a thwarted coup d’état, you were a member of the group mentioned, and you also maintained a close relationship with Citizen Capet.
$FAB_007_04x11_07_03
I condemn the activity of my colleagues in the countryside. For the good of France, we should stick together and solve our problems with discussion, not muskets.
$FAB_007_04x11_07_04
The typical prattle of a man who is afraid to end on the guillotine.
$FAB_007_04x11_07_05
And your prattle is typical of a man with no hard evidence who tries to incite the people!
$FAB_007_04x11_07_06
It’s true that he’s presented no evidence…
$FAB_007_04x11_07_07
We don’t need any for a traitor!
$FAB_007_09x10_08_QTitle
What was your role in the planned coup d’état?
$FAB_007_09x10_08_00
What was your role in the planned coup d’état?
$FAB_007_09x10_08_01
None. I knew nothing of such plans, and if there really were any, I am ashamed of my fellow deputies.
$FAB_007_09x10_08_02
My informants say that Roland not only participated in the plan, but he was also to lead the entire operation.
$FAB_007_09x10_08_03
I will punch your deceitful Jacobin face!
$FAB_007_09x10_08_04
Look at how arrogant he is!
$FAB_007_09x10_08_05
You do not like us all that much, do you?
$FAB_007_09x10_08_06
You want to kill me because I stand in your way to power. What in that would make me like you?
$FAB_007_09x10_08_07
You are giving us reasons to find you guilty.
$FAB_007_09x10_08_08
Even we ministers have our limits – we have honour that this charlatan wishes to blacken.
$FAB_007_09x10_08_09
As a minister of the interior, should you not have been aware of the treacherous plans of your colleagues from the Convention? A word or two to the right person would have been enough to solve the problem.
$FAB_007_09x10_08_10
…
$FAB_007_09x10_08_11
Answer, you bastard.
$FAB_007_09x10_08_12
I have nothing else to add on the matter.
$FAB_007_WIT_00_A_QTitle
Why did you leave the minister alone with the contents of the iron cabinet?
$FAB_007_WIT_00_A_00
Why did you leave the minister alone with the contents of the iron cabinet?
$FAB_007_WIT_00_A_01
That was his order. He told me to leave and make sure nobody enters the room. I was supposed not to return for 20 minutes.
$FAB_007_WIT_00_A_02
Did you follow these orders?
$FAB_007_WIT_00_A_03
Yes, at first, but I did have my doubts. I suspected the minister wanted to search for compromising documents, so I returned to him sooner.
$FAB_007_WIT_00_A_04
And what did you see?
$FAB_007_WIT_00_A_05
I saw the minister looking through documents. A few of them were set aside, and after I entered, he began to hide them beneath his coat.
$FAB_007_WIT_00_A_06
Did you notice any details? Anything to suspect what these documents could be?
$FAB_007_WIT_00_A_07
It was a quick glance and I only saw the seals. Most of them belonged to Citizen Capet, but I also noticed some other seals unknown to me. They were probably those of foreign monarchs.
$FAB_007_WIT_00_B_QTitle
How did the defendant behave when you caught him hiding documents?
$FAB_007_WIT_00_B_00
How did the defendant behave when you caught him hiding documents?
$FAB_007_WIT_00_B_01
He was angry, shouting that he had given me specific orders to wait outside the door and let nobody in.
$FAB_007_WIT_00_B_02
But you showed a truly Revolutionary disobedience to evil?
$FAB_007_WIT_00_B_03
Without Côté, we’d have never caught the traitor!
$FAB_007_WIT_00_B_04
I suspected there was a crime being committed in the room and I could not shut my eyes to it. It is in France’s best interests that her ministers are free of suspicion.
$FAB_007_WIT_01_A_QTitle
Do you know anything of Madame Roland’s influence on her husband’s behaviour?
$FAB_007_WIT_01_A_00
Do you know anything of Madame Roland’s influence on her husband’s behaviour?
$FAB_007_WIT_01_A_01
In my opinion, it was the minister’s wife who really held power.
$FAB_007_WIT_01_A_02
A puppet minister! As if being a traitor was not enough for him!
$FAB_007_WIT_01_A_03
A rat, not a minister…
$FAB_007_WIT_01_A_04
Why do you think so?
$FAB_007_WIT_01_A_05
I was always supposed to take all correspondence concerning his duties for the day immediately to Madame Roland.
$FAB_007_WIT_01_A_06
What a mockery!
$FAB_007_WIT_01_A_07
Shame!
$FAB_007_WIT_01_A_08
Thank you for your courage, France is grateful to you.
$FAB_007_WIT_01_B_QTitle
Do you know anything about the minister’s wife corrupting deputies of the Convention?
$FAB_007_WIT_01_B_00
Do you know anything about the minister’s wife corrupting deputies of the Convention?
$FAB_007_WIT_01_B_01
Nothing for sure, but once I was ordered to take a prostitute, named Giselle, from the Madame’s… facility right to the door of Deputy Pierre Vergniaud’s house.
$FAB_007_WIT_01_B_02
Do you need more evidence to sentence this treacherous couple to death?
$FAB_007_WIT_01_B_03
All Girondins are whoremongers!
$FAB_007_WIT_01_B_04
What was the purpose of taking the woman there?
$FAB_007_WIT_01_B_05
Does he really need to ask?
$FAB_007_WIT_01_B_06
This was not made clear to me. Nevertheless, I was told to bring her back later, and I can tell you… She returned with a black eye and dried blood under her fingernails. I gave her my handkerchief.
$FAB_007_WIT_01_B_07
Thank you for your courage, France is grateful to you.
