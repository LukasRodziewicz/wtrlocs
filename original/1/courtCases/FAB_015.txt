Before the Revolution, Claude Fauchet performed many important functions at the Church. As the royal chaplain, he was close to Citizen Capet, and as the archdeacon he had substantial power and many privileges unknown to most French people.
$FAB_015_DOC_01_01
The cardinal sensed the changing wind, and decided he would benefit more by standing with the people. He participated in the <a name="3" class="hidden">storming of the Bastille</a>, during which he was seen armed at the front. Later, as the constitutional bishop of Calvados and a Convention deputy, he was one of the people responsible for inspiring the <a name="4" class="hidden">September Massacres</a>.
$FAB_015_DOC_01_02
During the <a name="5" class="hidden">trial of Citizen Capet</a>, whom, may I remind you, the defendant knew in person, he voted for imprisonment and not for the guillotine. After the malefactor was beheaded, he protested openly against the execution in the “Journal des amis de la Constitution”.
$FAB_015_DOC_01_03
During the last days of the uprising in Caen, fragments of Fauchet’s <a name="6" class="hidden">articles</a> were discovered among the personal belongings of Joseph-Geneviève de Puisaye, one of the leaders of the mutiny. Investigating the imprisoned officers, it was also confirmed that the bishop had openly supported the uprising.
$FAB_015_DOC_01_04
During a search in the defendant’s residence, we discovered <a name="7" class="hidden">substantial amounts of gold</a>, a cellar full of wine, and remnants of a sumptuous <a name="8" class="hidden">supper for sixteen people</a>. During the investigation, we were not able to determine the origin of the wealth accumulated by the priest, or the identity of those who accompanied him during his uncontrolled and immoral feasts.

Fragments of Claude Fauchet’s articles, found in the belongings of de Puisaye:
$FAB_015_DOC_02_01
It is natural that in a country of equality and brotherhood, none of the regions or cities can exercise authority over another part of France. <a name="9" class="hidden">The Convention</a> has already played its historic role, and I think it is necessary to replace it entirely with regional boards or parliaments. A state founded on the rule of the people must rely upon <a name="10" class="hidden">local</a> and not central authorities.
$FAB_015_OnStart_00
Introduce yourself for the record.
$FAB_015_OnStart_01
Claude Fauchet.
$FAB_015_OnStart_02
Only that? Not “bishop”?
$FAB_015_OnStart_03
You asked for my name.
$FAB_015_OnStart_04
You are accused of supporting a Counter-Revolutionary uprising.
$FAB_015_OnStart_05
I support the freedom of the French to determine their own fate. If this is a crime, then I admit my guilt.
$FAB_015_OnStart_06
He’s one of us. He was at the Bastille, I saw him!
$FAB_015_OnStart_07
Even if this freedom leads to fratricidal wars?
$FAB_015_OnStart_08
As far as I know, it was the Convention sending the army to the north, not the federalists of Normandy sending their soldiers to Paris.
$FAB_015_OnGuilty_00
For supporting a Counter-Revolutionary mutiny, secretive Monarchism, and taking advantage of state functions for the illegal acquisition of property, I hereby sentence Bishop Fauchet to death.
$FAB_015_OnGuilty_01
This is a historic judgement. We are clearing the country of the relics of its former rule.
$FAB_015_OnGuilty_02
We want blood!
$FAB_015_OnGuilty_03
All bishops to the guillotine!
$FAB_015_OnGuilty_04
Crush the parasite!
$FAB_015_OnNotGuilty_00
There is no foundation for judging Bishop Fauchet guilty. You are free to go.
$FAB_015_OnNotGuilty_01
This relic of the Ancien Régime should die as Capet did.
$FAB_015_OnNotGuilty_02
Is the Judge a Royalist too?
$FAB_015_OnNotGuilty_03
I swear that lackey is about to kneel in front of the bishop!
$FAB_015_01x05_00_QTitle
Were you a chaplain at Versailles before the Revolution?
$FAB_015_01x05_00_00
Were you a chaplain at Versailles before the Revolution?
$FAB_015_01x05_00_01
I was the royal preacher.
$FAB_015_01x05_00_02
And later you voted on the fate of Citizen Capet, is that correct?
$FAB_015_01x05_00_03
Indeed.
$FAB_015_01x05_00_04
Tell me, did your personal acquaintance with him influence your vote?
$FAB_015_01x05_00_05
I do not think anybody would believe me if I said it did not, but yes, it had an influence, though I only knew him by sight and rarely talked to him.
$FAB_015_01x05_00_06
Did you vote against his beheading?
$FAB_015_01x05_00_07
Sodding Royalist.
$FAB_015_01x05_00_08
I bet he misses stuffing himself at Versailles.
$FAB_015_01x05_00_09
I did not vote for the guillotine, but I did that for all of us.
$FAB_015_01x05_00_10
Why?
$FAB_015_01x05_00_11
A king in jail, a real jail and not under house arrest, would still not pose a threat, would he?
$FAB_015_01x05_00_12
You said your acquaintance with Louis influenced your decision. Had you not known him, would you have voted to behead him?
$FAB_015_01x05_00_13
Yes, and I would have made a mistake. I went to court, and I saw that the monarchs of Europe had more solidarity with each other than their own subjects.
$FAB_015_01x03_01_QTitle
How is it that an archdeacon came to abandon his comfortable job…
$FAB_015_01x03_01_00
How is it that an archdeacon came to abandon his comfortable job then stand at the front of the people’s revolt?
$FAB_015_01x03_01_01
I never kept my political views secret in my sermons, and because of them I lost my position at court.
$FAB_015_01x03_01_02
So you took sides with the people, because neither Louis nor the aristocrats wanted you any more?
$FAB_015_01x03_01_03
No, it was because I took sides with the people that they did not want me. You are confusing the cause with the effect.
$FAB_015_01x03_01_04
You can present it in any way now, but let us stick to the facts.
$FAB_015_01x03_01_05
Of course, what do you wish to know?
$FAB_015_01x03_01_06
Did you stay at court until you were expelled?
$FAB_015_01x03_01_07
I stayed at court in the interest of the people! Remember what France was like at the time? Nobody did anything, and I tried to convince both the king and court that they needed to share their power with the people!
$FAB_015_01x03_01_08
You gorged yourself and poured fancy wine down your gullet, and now you’re telling us tales.
$FAB_015_02x07_02_QTitle
A substantial amount of gold was found in your palace. Where did it come from?
$FAB_015_02x07_02_00
A substantial amount of gold was found in your palace. Where did it come from?
$FAB_015_02x07_02_01
This substantial amount is only present in your files.
$FAB_015_02x07_02_02
Could you explain?
$FAB_015_02x07_02_03
I have a certain amount of gold jewellery just to secure my revenues, the other items are related to my faith – a cross, and a chalice. That is all.
$FAB_015_02x07_02_04
It is good you did not say “modest revenues”. As a court chaplain, you must have acquired considerable wealth. Later on, as a bishop and a member of the Convention, I expect you also had many opportunities to… enrich yourself.
$FAB_015_02x07_02_05
Of course he stole! Opportunity makes a thief!
$FAB_015_02x07_02_06
If you can present to the people any proof of my dishonesty, I will gladly wait.
$FAB_015_02x07_02_07
So you deny that you took advantage of your post to gain personal benefits?
$FAB_015_02x07_02_08
I did not work all those years for myself, but for the people!
$FAB_015_06x02_03_QTitle
We have evidence proving that you supported organisers of the coup in Normandy.
$FAB_015_06x02_03_00
We have evidence proving that you supported organisers of the coup in Normandy.
$FAB_015_06x02_03_01
I supported democracy for years, and these people wanted to enforce it. So yes, you could say that we shared the same… ideals.
$FAB_015_06x02_03_02
Democracy has already won here in Paris. There is no need to enforce it.
$FAB_015_06x02_03_03
If you say that a dozen men in Paris, who make decisions in corridors concerning the future of millions, can be called democracy, I am not going to argue. Is this the France we spilled blood for at the Bastille? Answer that question for yourselves.
$FAB_015_06x02_03_04
He’s right, we’ve exchanged one tyrant for several.
$FAB_015_06x02_03_05
So you admit you planned to change the system of the Republic?
$FAB_015_06x02_03_06
Perhaps the insurgents did. I simply wrote articles and talked to people. Forbid that, and you will be no better than Louis.
$FAB_015_06x02_03_07
Articles that inspired others to shed blood.
$FAB_015_06x02_03_08
Had we not shed blood, we would not have overthrown the monarchy, would we? I am not a supporter of violence, but you must admit that some changes cannot be made without it.
$FAB_015_10x03_04_QTitle
You wrote about transferring authority to the local administrations.
$FAB_015_10x03_04_00
You wrote about transferring authority to the local administrations.
$FAB_015_10x03_04_01
That would be just.
$FAB_015_10x03_04_02
At present, the civil administrator of Paris is Archbishop Jean-Baptiste Gobel. Did you want to bestow authority upon him?
$FAB_015_10x03_04_03
Perhaps. If a local board of Paris was established, it could be referred to as the municipal convention. But I fail to see what you are aiming at.
$FAB_015_10x03_04_04
Did the archbishop tell you to promote Federalist ideas? Priests can reach a great many people in the countryside. They could easily influence the elections for those councils of yours, and the archbishop would hold all lines of power.
$FAB_015_10x03_04_05
I would like to get a clear answer. Did you support the armed uprising against Paris, and did you do it on Gobel’s orders?
$FAB_015_10x03_04_06
No, and no.
$FAB_015_10x03_04_07
Are you familiar with the phrase “cui prodest scelus is fecit”? It means that whomever the crime advances is its perpetrator, and Gobel would have benefited most from your plan.
$FAB_015_10x03_04_08
Therefore, the one who benefits most from Gobel’s fall will be the one guilty of this campaign against me. Did I understand you correctly?
$FAB_015_09x06_05_QTitle
In your articles, you wrote that the Convention should be abolished.
$FAB_015_09x06_05_00
In your articles, you wrote that the Convention should be abolished.
$FAB_015_09x06_05_01
Rather, replaced.
$FAB_015_09x06_05_02
The Convention is not planning to dissolve itself, so it would have to be done by force, would it not?
$FAB_015_09x06_05_03
Please think on it for a moment – if I had planned a coup d’état, I would not be writing articles about it, but collecting weapons.
$FAB_015_09x06_05_04
And yet you helped those who planned it.
$FAB_015_09x06_05_05
That clergy scum probably wanted to feast at the court again.
$FAB_015_09x06_05_06
I do not know what information you have, but the only letters I wrote were to old friends from the times of the Revolution. You cannot have any letter in your files in which I would call for an uprising because I have never written anything of the sort.
$FAB_015_09x06_05_07
Let me make this clear to you – we know that you exchanged letters with Girondins, de Puisaye, for instance.
$FAB_015_09x06_05_08
I will not deny that we know each other.
$FAB_015_09x06_05_09
How can you explain your acquaintance with a leader of a Counter-Revolutionary rebellion?
$FAB_015_09x06_05_10
When I first met him, he was not rebelling at all.
$FAB_015_09x06_05_11
Then you are guilty of not informing the Convention of the planned rebellion.
$FAB_015_09x06_05_12
Did you hear that? Guilty!
$FAB_015_07x08_06_QTitle
I believe that your religion commands a moderation in eating…
$FAB_015_07x08_06_00
I believe that your religion commands a moderation in eating and drinking, as well as the accumulation of riches.
$FAB_015_07x08_06_01
As it is written in the holy book, “a covetous man shall not be satisfied with money: and he that loveth riches shall reap no fruit from them.”
$FAB_015_07x08_06_02
Yet you had many riches, and you also enjoyed indulging in pleasures.
$FAB_015_07x08_06_03
Did you see my dining room?
$FAB_015_07x08_06_04
I bet it’s bigger than my whole apartment.
$FAB_015_07x08_06_05
No, but from the records we know you hosted sumptuous feasts there.
$FAB_015_07x08_06_06
Saint John the Baptist said, “he that hath two coats, let him give to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do in like manner.” I have a table for sixteen people at home…
$FAB_015_07x08_06_07
We are supposed to share food with others, and my kitchen has always been open.
$FAB_015_07x08_06_08
I believe that your guests were not soon to be suffering from hunger. Would it not have been better to share with those who have no bread to give to their children?
$FAB_015_07x08_06_09
I went to sleep hungry yesterday!
$FAB_015_07x08_06_10
It is not my fault the present authorities have made people destitute.
$FAB_015_04x01_07_QTitle
What was your role in the massacres of September 1972?
$FAB_015_04x01_07_00
What was your role in the massacres of September 1972?
$FAB_015_04x01_07_01
I prayed for all of the victims.
$FAB_015_04x01_07_02
Was that not during Girondin rule?
$FAB_015_04x01_07_03
On the streets, it was mob rule.
$FAB_015_04x01_07_04
You were a Girondin.
$FAB_015_04x01_07_05
You could say that, but I do not know how my political leaning could be linked to the murder of priests.
$FAB_015_04x01_07_06
Why only priests? There were few priests in relation to the great number of people killed.
$FAB_015_04x01_07_07
A few? More than two hundred were murdered!
$FAB_015_04x01_07_08
You were in power at the time. What did you do to prevent the massacres?
$FAB_015_04x01_07_09
Your accusations are nothing more than politics…
$FAB_015_04x01_07_10
Answer the prosecutor’s question.
$FAB_015_04x01_07_11
And what would you have done in my place? If someone was there to kill and I had stood in their path, the only difference would have been one more corpse to dispose of.

$FAB_015_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_03_00
He claims that the investigators are exaggerating the extent of his wealth.
$FAB_015_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_03_00
He cannot explain it. He claims that someone must have planted the valuables.
$FAB_015_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_03_01
He refused to comment.
