Before the court stands Sébastien Thil, 19-years-old, son of a butcher and famous throughout the Section for the <a name="1" class="hidden">excellent pâtés</a> that he makes using his own recipe. Unfortunately, there have lately been serious indications that he produces them from cat meat.
$GEN_032_DOC_1_01
The accusations are based on the deposition given by <a name="3" class="hidden">Anna Renan</a>, who was stopped on the street with <a name="4" class="hidden">a bag of cats</a>. She had been catching animals <a name="5" class="hidden">on behalf of Sébastien Thil</a>, who was buying them. It is said that his famous pâtés were made from these cats.
$GEN_032_DOC_1_02
Upon the young cook’s arrest, the investigators found <a name="6" class="hidden">cat carcasses</a> in the butcher’s house, stored among other types of meat. One full box of them was found beneath a table.
$GEN_032_OnStart_00
Feeding people dead cats? This is outrageous!
$GEN_032_OnStart_01
Citizen, what is your name?
$GEN_032_OnStart_02
Sébastien Thil, kind sir.
$GEN_032_OnStart_03
You are accused of feeding the Citizens of Paris pâté made from cats. How do you plead to those charges?
$GEN_032_OnStart_04
What?! Says who? I bet one of them competing butchers, those rotten scoundrels! They lie! They’re dirty, lying swines, sir!
$GEN_032_OnStart_05
Better to lie like a pig than taste like a cat.
$GEN_032_OnStart_06
Says your supplier, who has been caught red-handed with a fresh supply of cats.
$GEN_032_OnStart_07
What supplier?
$GEN_032_OnStart_08
Pretending to be innocent will not help you. Do you have so many suppliers that you have lost count?
$GEN_032_OnStart_09
Renan, right?
$GEN_032_OnStart_10
That is right. Do you confess?
$GEN_032_OnStart_11
Absolutely not! Maybe she makes cat pâté herself?
$GEN_032_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Sébastien Thil to be guillotined! Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_032_OnGuilty_01
Where’s your evidence?! What about justice?!
$GEN_032_OnGuilty_02
It is a severe punishment, but public health is not a joke.
$GEN_032_OnNotGuilty_00
The judgement for Sébastien Thil is… not guilty! Take the defendant away.
$GEN_032_OnNotGuilty_01
Scandal! He will continue to sell us cat meat!
$GEN_032_OnNotGuilty_02
Objection! This is a sentence against Parisian stomachs!
$GEN_032_04x05_00_QTitle
What did you purchase the cats for?
$GEN_032_04x05_00_00
What did you purchase the cats for?
$GEN_032_04x05_00_01
Monsieur le juge, it’s… for medical purposes.
$GEN_032_04x05_00_02
What do you mean?
$GEN_032_04x05_00_03
Well, because of their skins, their fur. It works miracles on back pain, you know? I just wanted to earn a little on the side.
$GEN_032_04x05_00_04
Liar! People were coming to you for your pâté, not for skins!
$GEN_032_04x05_00_05
Were you killing cats?
$GEN_032_04x05_00_06
Yes, but not to feed them to people.
$GEN_032_04x05_00_07
Could you tell us at least one client who came to you for your packs?
$GEN_032_04x05_00_08
I wasn’t taking notes, sir. Various people were coming and going, buying skins then leaving.
$GEN_032_04x05_00_09
Not remembering is a convenient strategy.
$GEN_032_01x06_01_QTitle
Tell me, what happened with the meat of the cats you purchased?
$GEN_032_01x06_01_00
Tell me, what happened with the meat of the cats you purchased?
$GEN_032_01x06_01_01
It was delivered with the rest of the offal to aristocrats who have kennels.
$GEN_032_01x06_01_02
You were not turning them into pâté?
$GEN_032_01x06_01_03
Of course not! I would never feed people such filth!
$GEN_032_01x06_01_04
And when there were no deliveries of meat? There have been food shortages lately. Have you never added even a small amount?
$GEN_032_01x06_01_05
Spoil my pâté with meat from the streets? Never!
$GEN_032_01x06_01_06
If he’s such a saint, why won’t he prove it?
$GEN_032_01x06_01_07
The cat carcasses were found on the floor, no? That’s your proof! I never store meat for people on the floor!
$GEN_032_03x05_02_QTitle
Do you confirm paying Anna Renan to catch cats?
$GEN_032_03x05_02_00
Do you confirm paying Anna Renan to catch cats?
$GEN_032_03x05_02_01
She came to me, offering to bring me cats to cut up. I agreed, of course. I’m a butcher, after all. I can dress the flesh of a pig, so why not a cat?
$GEN_032_03x05_02_02
And then he serves it to the people! Has he no shame?
$GEN_032_03x05_02_03
It makes no difference to you what animal you are dressing?
$GEN_032_03x05_02_04
Well, you know, it’s easier to cut a pig because it’s much bigger. Smaller cats require more effort, as they…
$GEN_032_03x05_02_05
Would you dress human flesh too?
$GEN_032_03x05_02_06
Good God!
$GEN_032_03x05_02_07
What a terrible thought!
$GEN_032_03x05_02_08
I’m a butcher, not a killer!
$GEN_032_01x02_03_QTitle
What ingredients do you use to prepare your famous pâté?
$GEN_032_01x02_03_00
What ingredients do you use to prepare your famous pâté?
$GEN_032_01x02_03_01
Only natural ingredients, sir – some liver, pork shoulder, a bit of side, of course, or it will be too dry. You can also add lard.
$GEN_032_01x02_03_02
Enough…
$GEN_032_01x02_03_03
I always use four types of meat. To make it taste even better, you can add some onion or a small glass of cognac. It’s delicious, I swear.
$GEN_032_01x02_03_04
The accused forgot to mention cats – an important part of the recipe.
$GEN_032_01x02_03_05
That’s not true. Is there even one person who saw that I added feline meat to my pâté? Just one?
$GEN_032_01x02_03_06
I am quite certain that you were careful not to have any witnesses. What a dramatic tirade!
$GEN_032_03x04_04_QTitle
Call in the witness, Anna Renan.
$GEN_032_03x04_04_00
Call in the witness, Anna Renan.
$GEN_032_03x04_04_02
Please introduce yourself.
$GEN_032_03x04_04_03
Anna Renan, we bumped into each other…
$GEN_032_03x04_04_04
Yes, I remember…
$GEN_032_WIT_00_A_QTitle
How do you know that the pâté is made of cat meat?
$GEN_032_WIT_00_A_00
How do you know that the pâté is made of cat meat?
$GEN_032_WIT_00_A_01
From young Thil. He barked at me when I brought him old cats once. Said they were so old, mangy, and tough even dogs wouldn’t eat them.
$GEN_032_WIT_00_A_02
So he never said directly that he uses it for his pâté?
$GEN_032_WIT_00_A_03
What would that lad use it for if not for his delicacy? He said old meat is tough, so I brought him cats for a good pâté.
$GEN_032_WIT_00_A_04
Have you ever seen how the pâté was prepared?
$GEN_032_WIT_00_A_05
No.
$GEN_032_WIT_00_A_06
If you knew about this, why did you not inform the Guard immediately?
$GEN_032_WIT_00_A_07
I didn’t, which is my fault, but the bread’s getting more and more expensive and I’m not getting any richer. I have to make a living somehow, right?
$GEN_032_WIT_00_B_QTitle
How long have you been delivering cats to the accused?
$GEN_032_WIT_00_B_00
Have long have you been delivering cats to the accused?
$GEN_032_WIT_00_B_01
It was only the third sack when monsieur le juge ran into me on the street…
$GEN_032_WIT_00_B_02
So you started quite recently?
$GEN_032_WIT_00_B_03
About a week ago I heard rumours that the butcher’s son was buying cats. I quickly thought I could earn a few deniers as well.
$GEN_032_WIT_00_B_04
Where did you hear that?
$GEN_032_WIT_00_B_05
From Adele, she sells vegetables at the market, and it turned out she wasn’t making it up. Thil promised me 5 deniers for each cat.
$GEN_032_WIT_00_B_06
Instead of reporting this to the Guard, you went straight to him?
$GEN_032_WIT_00_B_07
Well… yeah. Catching a cat is like shelling peas, and it pays for bread.
$GEN_032_WIT_00_B_08
Gossip… Adele told her? Pff!
$GEN_032_WIT_01_A_QTitle
Did you try the dubious pâté?
$GEN_032_WIT_01_A_00
Did you try the dubious pâté?
$GEN_032_WIT_01_A_01
How? I can’t afford it.
$GEN_032_WIT_01_A_02
And if you could, would you try, knowing what it was made of?
$GEN_032_WIT_01_A_03
Why not? It wouldn’t kill me. Everyone’s saying how delicious it is, so maybe cat meat isn’t as bad as we think?
$GEN_032_WIT_01_A_04
Lead the witness out.
$GEN_032_WIT_01_A_06
Would you like to comment on that?
$GEN_032_WIT_01_A_07
I’m not making cat pâté. That’s all I have to say.
$GEN_032_WIT_01_B_QTitle
Tell us the names of the other people who were bringing cats to the defendant.
$GEN_032_WIT_01_B_00
Tell us the names of the other people who were bringing cats to the defendant.
$GEN_032_WIT_01_B_01
I don’t know them. But I wasn’t the only one catching them for young Thil, I know that for sure.
$GEN_032_WIT_01_B_02
You never met another supplier at the butcher’s?
$GEN_032_WIT_01_B_03
No, but I’ve only just started working for him.
$GEN_032_WIT_01_B_04
Lead the witness out.
$GEN_032_WIT_01_B_06
Would you like to comment on that?
$GEN_032_WIT_01_B_07
Different people bring various types of meat. I don’t have any regular employees.
