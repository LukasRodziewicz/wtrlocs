	We accuse Raphaël Gallois of conspiring against the Revolution. In his <a name="1" class="hidden">workshop</a>, this old <a name="2" class="hidden">Monarchist</a> has been making propaganda materials that depict <a name="3" class="hidden">the Capets</a> surrounded by a court entourage and soldiers.
$GEN_057_DOC_01_01
	Suspicion of his offence came to light at the beginning of the month. At that time, Citizen Gallois’s establishment was already under surveillance. When we were certain that the suspect had indeed made all of the propaganda materials himself, an officer in disguise was sent to conduct an interview inside the workshop. Answering the interrogator’s question, Citizen Gallois allegedly stated that the product he was offering was called “chess” – an ancient game originating in the east over 1,000 years ago.
$GEN_057_DOC_01_02
	The true face of the crime was revealed, however, only upon the <a name="7" class="hidden">demonstration of the rules</a> of this allegedly eastern pastime. In the game produced by Gallois, the king is the central and most important piece. The interviewer inquired about it several times, and the accused repeatedly insisted that the rules did not allow for the king to be taken. The queen, in turn, is the strongest piece on the board, which also raises anxiety. Other figures include knights, or noblemen, and towers reminiscent of the <a name="8" class="hidden">destroyed Bastille</a>. Even worse, each new game is begun by the player who controls <a name="9" class="hidden">the white king</a>, which is an explicit reference to Louis XVI.

It seems to me that this time our friends from the Guard got ahead of themselves…
$GEN_057_OnStart_01
I still need to question him. Introduce yourself.
$GEN_057_OnStart_02
Raphaël Gallois. A craftsman, your Grace.
$GEN_057_OnStart_03
Do you engage in propaganda activities?
$GEN_057_OnStart_04
Pro… pa… What exactly?
$GEN_057_OnStart_05
Propaganda.
$GEN_057_OnStart_06
Have you been persuading people to support the return to the monarchy?
$GEN_057_OnStart_07
To the guillotine with this snivelling royal lackey!
$GEN_057_OnStart_08
I’ve done no such thing, I just sat in my workshop and worked as always.
$GEN_057_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Raphaël Gallois to death for supporting the monarchy.
$GEN_057_OnGuilty_01
This is how those who support the monsters of Versailles end up!
$GEN_057_OnGuilty_02
These days, anyone can be sentenced for anything.
$GEN_057_OnPrison_00
Citizen Gallois will spend five years in prison for spreading Monarchist propaganda.
$GEN_057_OnPrison_01
Good, they’ll think twice before they start agitating for Capet!
$GEN_057_OnPrison_02
These days, anyone can be sentenced for anything.
$GEN_057_OnNotGuilty_00
I hereby declare Raphaël Gallois not guilty! This accusation was completely absurd.
$GEN_057_OnNotGuilty_01
The judge is a royal lapdog!
$GEN_057_01x09_00_QTitle
Are you a supporter of the monarchy?

I try to pay taxes on time, the rest can kiss my–
$GEN_057_01x09_00_02
Mind your manners!
$GEN_057_01x09_00_03
This old codger has the audacity to talk back to the Revolutionary court.
$GEN_057_01x09_00_04
There is, however, a white king in your game, correct?
$GEN_057_01x09_00_05
Well, what’s wrong with that?
$GEN_057_01x09_00_06
White was the traditional colour of Louis Capet – do not pretend to be unaware of that.
$GEN_057_01x09_00_07
It never occurred to me, I swear. I have done nothing against the new authority.
$GEN_057_02x07_01_QTitle
Did you show your game to anyone that was willing?
$GEN_057_02x07_01_00
Did you show your game to anyone that was willing?
$GEN_057_02x07_01_01
Chess? It’s not my game, but yes, I’ve taught hundreds of people how to play.
$GEN_057_02x07_01_02
Playing cards also feature a king and queen, so what?
$GEN_057_02x07_01_03
Is the game about protecting the king?
$GEN_057_02x07_01_04
That is the goal.
$GEN_057_02x07_01_05
Why the king, and not the nation?
$GEN_057_02x07_01_06
I wouldn’t know, this game is hundreds of years old, I–
$GEN_057_02x07_01_07
Could you not have changed the rules?
$GEN_057_02x07_01_08
I wouldn’t know how to. After all I am just a simple craftsman, not–
$GEN_057_02x07_01_09
But you could have chosen a different product to manufacture, is that correct?
$GEN_057_02x07_01_10
Well, I could have, but I didn’t think of it.
$GEN_057_03x06_02_QTitle
Does the game feature a king and queen?
$GEN_057_03x06_02_00
Does the game feature a king and queen?
$GEN_057_03x06_02_01
Indeed.
$GEN_057_03x06_02_02
Who invented this game?
$GEN_057_03x06_02_03
I don’t know, they say it’s an ancient game from Persia or India or somewhere.
$GEN_057_03x06_02_04
Liar! Louis’s supporters are always liars!
$GEN_057_03x06_02_05
I know only as much as my father taught me.
$GEN_057_03x06_02_06
He also produced this game?
$GEN_057_03x06_02_07
In his old age, after he sold his farm.
$GEN_057_04x08_03_QTitle
The Guard’s interrogator claims that some of your pawns are reminiscent of the Bastille towers.
$GEN_057_04x08_03_00
The Guard’s interrogator claims that some of your pawns are reminiscent of the Bastille towers.
$GEN_057_04x08_03_01
They are.
$GEN_057_04x08_03_02
Why?
$GEN_057_04x08_03_03
Because in chess you need to make towers, like those on a castle.
$GEN_057_04x08_03_04
But why identical to the Bastille’s towers?
$GEN_057_04x08_03_05
I’ve never seen any other, so I copied the ones I knew.
$GEN_057_04x08_03_06
Is this prosecutor blind or stupid?
$GEN_057_05x02_04_QTitle
Did you conceal your workshop?
$GEN_057_05x02_04_00
Did you conceal your workshop?
$GEN_057_05x02_04_01
Not at all, it’s on the ground floor and I have a signboard. There’s a narrow door and the display window is tiny, but the rent is low, monsieur le juge.
$GEN_057_05x02_04_02
Are you brave, bold, or just stupid?
$GEN_057_05x02_04_03
I do not understand, monsieur prosecutor. I wanted to attract customers, why would I hide?
$GEN_057_05x02_04_04
Answer the questions, Louis’s dog!
$GEN_057_05x02_04_05
Where did you get so much merchandise? For what were you preparing?
$GEN_057_05x02_04_06
Preparing? Well, I make the pieces from wood first, then I paint them. But people have stopped buying recently…
$GEN_057_05x02_04_07
What do you mean?
$GEN_057_05x02_04_08
Chess used to be bought mainly by the high-born and the clergy, but now, obviously, they have other things on their minds.
$GEN_057_05x02_04_09
Did you hear that? It’s a confession!
$GEN_057_04x01_05_QTitle
Did you notice that the National Guard was watching you?
$GEN_057_04x01_05_00
Did you notice that the National Guard was watching you?
$GEN_057_04x01_05_01
I did not.
$GEN_057_04x01_05_02
And if you had, would you have run away?
$GEN_057_04x01_05_03
I wouldn’t have even thought about it. Why would I run?
$GEN_057_04x01_05_04
You had shelves full of Counter-Revolutionary propaganda!
$GEN_057_04x01_05_05
He’s an honest man, why would he run?
$GEN_057_04x01_05_06
This accusation is a joke. I have nothing to explain.
$GEN_057_04x01_05_07
Well, you had better think it through. Your life is at stake.
