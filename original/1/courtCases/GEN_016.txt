In the dock is Hélène Gignac, a 55-year-old laundress from Paris. She is an exemplary wife and mother, <a name="1" class="hidden">very religious</a>, and is admired by both her neighbours and clients.
$GEN_016_DOC_01_01
Her <a name="2" class="hidden">husband</a>, a carpenter, has owned his shop for many years and they both pay taxes in a timely manner.
$GEN_016_DOC_01_02
The charges were brought by Raymond Houllier, the owner of an apothecary where the defendant was detained by gendarmes during an attempted theft. Gignac broke the display window and tried to enter the store. She testified that she was forced to do it by soap shortages and the exorbitant prices of whatever soap was left to buy.
$GEN_016_DOC_01_03
She seemed to be <a name="4" class="hidden">desperate</a>, to the point of wounding her hands with the broken glass. She was found sitting in front of the window, crying. The gendarmes dressed her wounds and then arrested her, charging her with vandalism and attempted theft. We suspect that she wanted to use the stolen goods for <a name="5" class="hidden">speculation</a>, though it’s true that there was <a name="6" class="hidden">no soap</a> in her laundry.
$GEN_016_DOC_01_04
Raymond Houllier claims that when he ran from his apartment above the store, Mrs Gignac took a sliver of glass and assaulted him. We do not know why she would do that. Houllier suspects that by vandalising the store, stealing, and attacking him, she wanted to <a name="7" class="hidden">take revenge</a> because he had previously refused to sell her a box of soap on credit.

Evidence:

$GEN_016_OnStart_00
Try to understand her, these are challenging times!
$GEN_016_OnStart_01
What is your name?
$GEN_016_OnStart_02
Hélène Gignac. I’m an ordinary laundress who simply wishes to be able to work. I never wanted to hurt anyone.
$GEN_016_OnStart_03
She wouldn’t hurt a fly!
$GEN_016_OnStart_04
I shall rely on the notes of the case, and not on the remarks of the audience.
$GEN_016_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Citizen Hélène Gignac to death by guillotine.
$GEN_016_OnGuilty_01
Harsh but fair.
$GEN_016_OnGuilty_02
This is inhuman!
$GEN_016_OnGuilty_03
How can you kill an innocent woman?!
$GEN_016_OnGuilty_04
You monsters!
$GEN_016_OnPrison_00
I sentence Citizen Hélène Gignac to prison. Take her away!
$GEN_016_OnPrison_01
That should teach her how problems should be solved.
$GEN_016_OnPrison_02
Poor woman.
$GEN_016_OnPrison_03
Let’s just hope she survives in prison.
$GEN_016_OnPrison_04
Prison is filled with innocent people!
$GEN_016_OnNotGuilty_00
I find Citizen Hélène Gignac not guilty. You are free to go.
$GEN_016_OnNotGuilty_01
I understand that you sympathise with the people, but she was guilty.
$GEN_016_OnNotGuilty_02
Huzzah!
$GEN_016_OnNotGuilty_03
Finally a compassionate judge!
$GEN_016_OnNotGuilty_04
We need more judges like him!
$GEN_016_01x03_00_QTitle
I heard that you are religious.
$GEN_016_01x03_00_00
I heard that you are religious, but I do not see the connection between your deed and the Ten Commandments.
$GEN_016_01x03_00_01
My husband and I are barely making ends meet. I asked Mr Raymond for a loan, but he refused. I just wanted to be able to work, and said I would make it up to him.
$GEN_016_01x03_00_02
And robbery was the solution?
$GEN_016_01x03_00_03
No, but starving to death wasn’t either.
$GEN_016_01x03_00_04
Are you saying that a lack of soap would kill you? Your husband is also working.
$GEN_016_01x03_00_05
He’s a carpenter, and wood’s also hard to come by.
$GEN_016_01x03_00_06
You could have changed profession, asked your family or the authorities for help… but you preferred to steal?
$GEN_016_01x03_00_07
The authorities only help themselves.
$GEN_016_01x03_00_08
Why don’t you change your profession?!
$GEN_016_01x04_01_QTitle
Can you explain your behaviour?
$GEN_016_01x04_01_00
Can you explain your behaviour?
$GEN_016_01x04_01_01
Clients come to me, but I can't work without soap, so they go somewhere else. The laundry is my whole life, and I already experienced extreme poverty before. Thanks to the laundry, I could live with dignity.
$GEN_016_01x04_01_02
How dignified was that assault?
$GEN_016_01x04_01_03
I really didn’t want it to happen.
$GEN_016_01x04_01_04
You just wanted to steal?
$GEN_016_01x04_01_05
I wanted to be able to afford bread.
$GEN_016_01x04_01_06
The Revolution was supposed to make things better!
$GEN_016_01x04_01_07
That is not an excuse. The store owner also wants to afford bread.
$GEN_016_01x04_01_08
I didn’t mean to take much from him. Besides, he’s much better off than most of us.
$GEN_016_03x05_02_QTitle
Are you aware that the law states speculation is punishable by death?
$GEN_016_03x05_02_00
Are you aware that the law states speculation is punishable by death?
$GEN_016_03x05_02_01
Yes, I know, I just needed soap for–
$GEN_016_03x05_02_02
For work, yes. However, in your situation speculation would be much more profitable. You could sell the stolen soap and demand a much higher price. Sooner or later you would have found a buyer.
$GEN_016_03x05_02_03
Soap isn’t that expensive.
$GEN_016_03x05_02_04
Really? You saw with your own eyes how difficult it was to obtain. If you were willing to steal it, someone else would be willing to pay you for the goods.
$GEN_016_03x05_02_05
And where would I find that buyer? I don’t know anyone. You already saw there was nothing at my home. That fellow in the uniform searched carefully.
$GEN_016_03x05_02_06
They’re speculating themselves – they don’t know how we live!
$GEN_016_03x06_03_QTitle
Where did you buy soap before?
$GEN_016_03x06_03_00
Where did you buy soap before?
$GEN_016_03x06_03_01
Always at the same place, a warehouse in the suburbs.
$GEN_016_03x06_03_02
Not from Citizen Houllier?
$GEN_016_03x06_03_03
The warehouse offered a much lower price. My husband and I always bought a whole box because it lasted longer.
$GEN_016_03x06_03_04
Why did you not go to that warehouse this time?
$GEN_016_03x06_03_05
I did, but they didn’t have anything to sell. What was I supposed to do? Besides, in the end, I didn’t steal anything…
$GEN_016_03x06_03_06
Because you were caught.
$GEN_016_03x06_03_07
Yes, but the soap was left untouched. How am I guilty?
$GEN_016_03x06_03_08
The law does not work like that, Citizen.
$GEN_016_07x08_04_QTitle
Mr Houllier claims that you attacked him with a sliver of glass. Is that true?
$GEN_016_07x08_04_00
Mr Houllier claims that you attacked him with a sliver of glass. Is that true?
$GEN_016_07x08_04_01
I wanted to ask him not to press charges. I ran to him, ready to beg, but he pushed me away…
$GEN_016_07x08_04_02
You wanted to ask him not to press charges while carrying a piece of sharp glass?
$GEN_016_07x08_04_03
Well, it just happened…
$GEN_016_07x08_04_04
So, you were running towards another person, covered in blood with a sharp object in your hands?
$GEN_016_07x08_04_05
It could look like that…
$GEN_016_07x08_04_06
Come on, it’s just an old lady.
$GEN_016_07x08_04_07
Mr Houllier claims it was an attempted assault. He even suggested that it could be revenge.
$GEN_016_07x08_04_08
Not at all! I didn’t even realise that I had that piece of glass in my hand. I was in a shock, and there was so much blood.
$GEN_016_02x04_05_QTitle
What about your husband’s support? Did he not notice your…?
$GEN_016_02x04_05_00
What about your husband’s support? Did he not notice your fragile state or suspect that you might do something drastic?
$GEN_016_02x04_05_01
Since the laundry stopped operating he’s had to work twice as hard.
$GEN_016_02x04_05_02
Don’t you think that now he will be even more worried?
$GEN_016_02x04_05_03
I had to do something! After all he’s done for me, I just couldn’t watch him getting even more exhausted every day.
$GEN_016_02x04_05_04
Leave them alone! There’s no shortage of real criminals.
$GEN_016_04x06_06_QTitle
Are you sure you are not exaggerating…?
$GEN_016_04x06_06_00
Are you sure you are not exaggerating? The supplies would sooner or later return and the prices would stabilise. Maybe you should have been more patient?
$GEN_016_04x06_06_01
Maybe, but I’m a simple woman and I try to solve problems as fast as possible.
$GEN_016_04x06_06_02
Did you just explain that not thinking about the consequences was due to a lack of thought? Why not call it what it was? Stupidity.
$GEN_016_04x06_06_03
That’s a bit too much, don’t you think?
$GEN_016_04x06_06_04
I use simple words when talking to simple people.
$GEN_016_04x06_06_05
Who do they think we are?
$GEN_016_08x03_07_QTitle
Call in Mr Raymond Houllier.
$GEN_016_08x03_07_00
Call in Mr Raymond Houllier.
$GEN_016_08x03_07_02
Do you know the defendant? Has she bought anything from your shop in the past?
$GEN_016_08x03_07_03
No, I’d never seen her until recently.
$GEN_016_08x03_07_04
Describe the time you first met.
$GEN_016_08x03_07_05
She wanted to buy soap, but didn’t have any money.
$GEN_016_08x03_07_06
What did you do?
$GEN_016_08x03_07_07
I told her to leave! We all have it tough and no one’s helping me.
$GEN_016_08x03_07_08
Did she promise to pay you back?
$GEN_016_08x03_07_09
Yes, but why would I believe her? I don’t know her, and she’d never bought anything at my place before. Only my frequent customers can get something on credit.
$GEN_016_WIT_00_A_QTitle
How would you describe the behaviour of Citizen Gignac on that day?
$GEN_016_WIT_00_A_00
How would you describe the behaviour of Citizen Gignac on that day?
$GEN_016_WIT_00_A_01
She broke my window and tried to stab me with a piece of glass. What’s there to describe?
$GEN_016_WIT_00_A_02
Answer the question.
$GEN_016_WIT_00_A_03
She was mad and wanted revenge.
$GEN_016_WIT_00_A_04
Maybe she was not really intending to attack you?
$GEN_016_WIT_00_A_05
Then why would she rush towards me with a piece of glass?
$GEN_016_WIT_00_B_QTitle
Was Mrs Gignac saying anything when she, as you put it, tried to stab you with a piece of glass?
$GEN_016_WIT_00_B_00
Was Mrs Gignac saying anything when she, as you put it, tried to stab you with a piece of glass?
$GEN_016_WIT_00_B_01
Nothing specific, just whining, crying, yelling…
$GEN_016_WIT_00_B_02
Did you understand anything you could quote?
$GEN_016_WIT_00_B_03
No, it was just the mumbling of a madwoman, nothing more.
$GEN_016_WIT_00_B_04
Did you restrain her?
$GEN_016_WIT_00_B_05
You could say that.
$GEN_016_WIT_00_B_06
He beat up an old woman.
$GEN_016_WIT_00_B_07
Did you have a conversation afterwards?
$GEN_016_WIT_00_B_08
No, she cried all the way to the station.

Oh, dear God, why? What will happen to my laundry? We only just stopped living like animals…
$GEN_016_UNIQUE_QUESTION_00
Was the defendant trying to buy soap?
$GEN_016_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_00_00
Yes, but she did not have enough money.
$GEN_016_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_00_00
Yes, but Houllier refused to sell it.
$GEN_016_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_00_01
No, she came to steal it.
$GEN_016_UNIQUE_QUESTION_01
Is the laundry the only source of income for the defendant’s family?
$GEN_016_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_01_00
No, her husband is a carpenter.
$GEN_016_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_00
No, her son is serving in the army.
$GEN_016_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_01
Yes, nobody else in her family is working.
$GEN_016_UNIQUE_QUESTION_02
Did the defendant say anything to the victim during the attack?
$GEN_016_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_02_00
No, she just yelled something incomprehensible.
$GEN_016_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_02_00
Yes, she said she was going to kill him.
$GEN_016_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_02_01
She told him to give her the soap.
