Speech for the prosecution by Antoine Quentin Fouquier-Tinville
$FAB_903_DOC_1_00
Compatriots! Citizen Capet, previously known as King Louis XVI of France, must be punished for conspiring against the people of France!
$FAB_903_DOC_1_01
Louis Capet tried todefend his absolute authority by plotting against the National Constituent Assembly and the people of France. We all remember July of 1789. He gathered an army, 15 foreign regiments, and ordered them to surround Paris. Soldiers led by Baron de Besenval were to capture deputies and shoot at Citizens defending the reforms! And so they did! The Royal German Regiment drew first blood!
$FAB_903_DOC_1_02
After the plot failed, Louis Capet <a name="3" class="hidden">tried to flee</a> the country with his family and scheme with foreign monarchs abroad. Is that not the reason for him leaving the Tuileries one night in June of 1791 using someone else’s passport? Was he not heading to Montmédy where his loyal armies were stationed, ready to take him to Austria? If it were not for Postmaster Douret, this scheme could have ended tragically for us.
$FAB_903_DOC_1_03
Louis Capet will never abandon the thought of <a name="5" class="hidden">suppressing the Revolution by force</a>. Before the events of 1792, he gave orders for the Swiss Guard stationed in the Tuileries to be doubled. He conducted a public muster in front of horrified Citizens. The people had no choice! They had to act before Capet attacked! Citizens of Paris who tried to stop the madness were shot at, even after Capet’s escape to the National Assembly.

	Your Grace!

	Soon we will come to Your Majesty’s rescue. However, for the time being I implore YM to muster local troops that remain loyal. I shall issue a warning to YM’s subjects that any and all who dare raise a hand against YM would suffer the direst of consequences.

	My armies await my orders to curb the tide of anarchy in YM’s country.

Monsieur le juge, the crowd in front of the building is enraged. There may soon be a massacre.
$FAB_903_OnStart_GUARD_01
A rumour has spread about hidden evidence of Citizen Capet’s treason. People have gone mad.
$FAB_903_OnStart_KING_00
What evidence?
$FAB_903_OnStart_JUDGE_00
I will go to them. I would ask you all to stay in your seats until I return.
$FAB_903_OnStart_MENTOR_00
It is true. Evidence of Capet’s guilt has been found.
$FAB_903_OnStart_PROSECUTOR_00
Really?!
$FAB_903_OnStart_00
Would the defendant like to explain why he concealed his secure iron cabinet, and the documents hidden within, from the Convention?
$FAB_903_OnStart_01
I hid nothing from the Convention. No one asked me about the existence of such things.
$FAB_903_OnStart_02
You kept your correspondence well hidden under lock and key. It could only be retrieved with the assistance of a master locksmith.
$FAB_903_OnStart_03
Any affluent Parisian has a lockable cabinet. I, for one, am keenly interested in locksmithing.
$FAB_903_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Citizen Capet to death by guillotine! Take the convict away.
$FAB_903_OnGuilty_01
Long live the people!
$FAB_903_OnGuilty_02
Down with the tyrant!
$FAB_903_OnPrison_00
I sentence Citizen Capet to prison! Take him away.
$FAB_903_OnPrison_01
Arrest the Judge immediately!
$FAB_903_OnPrison_02
Outrageous!
$FAB_903_OnNotGuilty_00
The verdict in the case of Citizen Capet is… not guilty! The defendant is free to go.
$FAB_903_OnNotGuilty_01
Arrest the Judge immediately!
$FAB_903_OnNotGuilty_02
Outrageous!

You were aware of the plans of the Emperor and the Duke of Brunswick. Why did you not…?
$FAB_903_04x05_00_00
You were aware of the plans of the Emperor and the Duke of Brunswick. Why did you not warn the National Assembly and the army?
$FAB_903_04x05_00_01
…
$FAB_903_04x05_00_02
You need to speak up.
$FAB_903_04x05_00_03
I did not deem their threats serious.
$FAB_903_04x05_00_04
That reeks of treason.
$FAB_903_04x05_00_05
Allow me to quote: “My armies await my orders.” Does that not sound like a serious threat?
$FAB_903_04x05_00_06
Prince Charles is impetuous, but I never once thought he would dare attack France.
$FAB_903_01x06_01_QTitle
Was the accused responsible for the attempts to bribe…
$FAB_903_01x06_01_00
Was the accused responsible for the attempts to bribe deputies of the Assembly in order to abolish it?
$FAB_903_01x06_01_01
I did not sign that document, sir.
$FAB_903_01x06_01_02
But it was found in a cache belonging to the accused. It speaks of thanks from the King.
$FAB_903_01x06_01_03
My intention was to put Minister Roland on trial for abusing his power. I kept the document for that occasion.
$FAB_903_01x06_01_04
A trial that has not happened for three years now!
$FAB_903_01x06_01_05
A trial that needs to happen. Roland will confess to the guillotine!
$FAB_903_01x06_01_06
That is the fault of the minister of justice. I ordered him to carry out an investigation and to punish the minister of internal affairs.
$FAB_903_05x03_02_QTitle
Then why would the emperor mention shortly before the journey that he expected to see…
$FAB_903_05x03_02_00
Then why would the emperor mention shortly before the journey that he expected to see the accused and his family within his borders shortly before said journey?
$FAB_903_05x03_02_01
Mere coincidence. The emperor simply feared for the life of his sister. It is no secret that the European monarchs have a warped view of the Revolution. They see it as a weapon against monarchy.
$FAB_903_05x03_02_02
Was the presence of forces in Montmédy intended to escort the accused to Austria also a mere coincidence?
$FAB_903_05x03_02_03
I swear I had nothing to do with that!
$FAB_903_01x07_03_QTitle
Did the accused intend to lead the emperor’s forces to France?
$FAB_903_01x07_03_00
Did the accused intend to lead the emperor’s forces to France?
$FAB_903_01x07_03_01
I certainly did not.
$FAB_903_01x07_03_02
In his letter, the emperor was quite clear about his intentions to “return order” to France.
$FAB_903_01x07_03_03
I do not know the plans of Emperor Leopold, but I do know that I would never allow anyone to spill French blood.
$FAB_903_01x07_03_04
But you must admit that such an offer from an enemy government paints you in a bad light.
$FAB_903_01x07_03_05
Dear God, it is merely personal correspondence from my brother-in-law!
$FAB_903_01x07_03_06
It is not personal when the letters exchanged are by rulers and deal in matters of national security.
$FAB_903_06x05_04_QTitle
Citizen, would you call Minister Jean-Marie Roland a loyal servant?
$FAB_903_06x05_04_00
Citizen, would you call Minister Jean-Marie Roland a loyal servant?
$FAB_903_06x05_04_01
He was always loyal to France and the Revolution. There was a time when I held him in high regard.
$FAB_903_06x05_04_02
We have a letter from the minister here in which he encourages bribery of deputies of the Convention. I have heard that when the cabinet containing new evidence was discovered, Roland dismissed his associates so he could carefully go through the contents by himself…
$FAB_903_06x05_04_03
During one meeting, I joked that we would be able to save the balance of the Republic if I could find just one honest man in the Convention who would back me…
$FAB_903_06x05_04_04
It would seem your humourless joke was taken quite seriously.
$FAB_903_06x05_04_05
Judging by what was left, I dread to think what documents the minister succeeded in destroying.
$FAB_903_06x05_04_06
I hope the accused does not lose his job. It would be a pity…
$FAB_903_02x08_05_QTitle
Was the Swiss Guard going to help during the duke’s attack on Paris?
$FAB_903_02x08_05_00
Was the Swiss Guard going to help during the duke’s attack on Paris?
$FAB_903_02x08_05_01
No, they were only supposed to keep my family safe.
$FAB_903_02x08_05_02
You doubled the numbers of the Guard before the events in August. It seems as though everything was going according to the Duke of Brunswick’s plan…
$FAB_903_02x08_05_03
Nonsense! I cannot be held responsible for the intentions Prince Charles stated in this letter! Why would I act against my own people when his attack was already doomed to failure?

He was afraid for the life of his friend, Citizen Capet.
$FAB_903_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_01_01
He was afraid for the life of innocent Citizens.
$FAB_903_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_02_00
He claims it was merely a jest.
$FAB_903_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_02_00
Apparently he misspoke.
$FAB_903_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_02_01
He denies the situation took place.
$FAB_903_UNIQUE_ANSWER_CORRECT_03_00
He did not consider the threat to be serious.
$FAB_903_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_03_00
He forgot.
$FAB_903_UNIQUE_ANSWER_NOT_CORRECT_03_01
He claims to having issued the warning but was ignored.
