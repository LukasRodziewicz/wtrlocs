	Lucas Adnet, a craftsman and single <a name="1" class="hidden">father of two daughters</a>, has been accused of murder and defiling a dead body. The case was brought to our attention thanks to a denunciation made by a fellow Citizen. During an <a name="2" class="hidden">evening reception</a> a doctor of medical sciences, Jean-Joël Gaumont, was delighted with the beautifully made tableware. The physician asked the hosts for the manufacturer’s address and visited him the following day <a name="3" class="hidden">in his workshop</a>.
$GEN_053_DOC_01_01
	When looking at Lucas Adnet’s samples of <a name="4" class="hidden">cutlery with bone handles</a>, he noticed a cleaver with a long handle that, disturbingly, the physician instantly recognised as human bone.
$GEN_053_DOC_01_02
	Gaumont bid Adnet farewell and headed to the nearest National Guard station to make a denunciation. During the search, they found bones stored <a name="5" class="hidden">in a shed</a>, sorted by size in wooden boxes. The stench was difficult to bear, even for the most seasoned officers…
$GEN_053_DOC_01_03
	The only information revealed during the investigation was that Adnet had bought the bones at a <a name="7" class="hidden">street market</a> from the trader Claudine Plouffe. Doctors brought in from Salpêtrière hospital prepared a bone inspection report that is attached to the case file.
$GEN_053_DOC_02_00
The report created by the physicians from Salpêtrière hospital:
$GEN_053_DOC_02_01
	The findings near Lucas Adnet’s workshop have vexed us deeply. We discovered both human and animal bones. Despite our best efforts, we were not able to find a complete skeleton. However, the boxes contained <a name="9" class="hidden">two jawbones</a>, two pelvic pieces, several tibias, and femoral bones of various sizes. We estimate that they belonged to four or five people…
$GEN_053_OnStart_00
Are you the craftsman, Lucas Adnet?
$GEN_053_OnStart_01
Indeed, sir.
$GEN_053_OnStart_02
The correct term is “monsieur le juge”.
$GEN_053_OnStart_03
I apologise. Yes, monsieur le juge, I have been producing cutlery for at least ten years.
$GEN_053_OnStart_04
Were you aware that there were human bones in your workshop?
$GEN_053_OnStart_05
Not at all, monsieur le juge. I only looked for quality. I am not a doctor.
$GEN_053_OnStart_06
What do you mean by quality?
$GEN_053_OnStart_07
That the bones are not fragile or cracked.
$GEN_053_OnStart_08
Bet he knows how to use a knife to make sure the bones are intact!
$GEN_053_OnStart_09
He must strangle or drown them.
$GEN_053_OnStart_10
So you must know which bones best suit your needs?
$GEN_053_OnStart_11
Some suit them, some do not, monsieur le juge. I usually buy cow bones in the market. Pig bones are worse, but a boar will do.
$GEN_053_OnGuilty_00
The evidence leaves no margin for doubt. Lucas Adnet, I sentence you to the guillotine.
$GEN_053_OnGuilty_01
That is too mild a punishment.
$GEN_053_OnGuilty_02
Feed his bones to pigs!
$GEN_053_OnPrison_00
Citizen Adnet, I find you guilty of murder and defiling corpses. You will spend the rest of your life in prison.
$GEN_053_OnPrison_01
He lives while his victims are used by nobles to stir soup.
$GEN_053_OnNotGuilty_00
Citizen Adnet, next time you see suspicious bones at the street market, make a denunciation. For now, you are free to go.
$GEN_053_OnNotGuilty_01
Why? Nothing that we have heard today stands in his favour.
$GEN_053_OnNotGuilty_02
The judge has lost his mind.
$GEN_053_OnNotGuilty_03
Hey, craftsman, you’d better stay off them streets, ’cause you ain’t foolin’ us.
$GEN_053_02x04_00_QTitle
Call in Dr Gaumont.
$GEN_053_02x04_00_00

$GEN_053_01x09_01_QTitle
Citizen Adnet, are you raising two daughters by yourself?
$GEN_053_01x09_01_00
Citizen Adnet, are you raising two daughters by yourself?
$GEN_053_01x09_01_01
Yes I am, but sometimes my sister helps me.
$GEN_053_01x09_01_02
What happened to their mother?
$GEN_053_01x09_01_03
She drowned when my youngest was two years old.
$GEN_053_01x09_01_04
Where was she buried?
$GEN_053_01x09_01_05
Nowhere, the body was never found.
$GEN_053_01x09_01_06
He used her to make forks!
$GEN_053_01x09_01_07
Do the girls attend school?
$GEN_053_01x09_01_08
I don’t trust schools, they teach nothing of use.
$GEN_053_01x09_01_09
What about learning to read and write?
$GEN_053_01x09_01_10
Anything that’s useful in life I can teach them myself.
$GEN_053_08x05_02_QTitle
Did you keep all the bones in the shed?
$GEN_053_08x05_02_00
Did you keep all the bones in the shed?
$GEN_053_08x05_02_01
Most of them.
$GEN_053_08x05_02_02
Why there, of all places?
$GEN_053_08x05_02_03
Bones are best stored where maggots can eat away the flesh and fat. They squeeze through the boards and lay eggs, and then their larvae feast. Maggots are real gluttons.
$GEN_053_08x05_02_04
They?
$GEN_053_08x05_02_05
Flies.
$GEN_053_08x05_02_06
Freak!
$GEN_053_08x05_02_07
So you are saying that the bones you bought were still covered in flesh?
$GEN_053_08x05_02_08
Usually, yes. Fresh ones are easier to carve. They’re soft, delicate…
$GEN_053_08x05_02_09
Were you not bothered by the stench?
$GEN_053_08x05_02_10
On the contrary, the smell represents both life and death. Sometimes at night I would come to the shed...
$GEN_053_08x05_02_11
To smell the rotting meat?
$GEN_053_08x05_02_12
Decay is a fascinating process. On dead flesh, insects lay eggs that hatch then grow. Life doesn’t end, but turns into more life. I like to watch it.
$GEN_053_08x05_02_13
Does it give you… pleasure?
$GEN_053_08x05_02_14
Yes. I guess it’s how a gardener feels when he observes his flowers.
$GEN_053_07x09_03_QTitle
You claim to have bought human jawbones at a street market?
$GEN_053_07x09_03_00
You claim to have bought human jawbones at a street market?
$GEN_053_07x09_03_01
Yes, monsieur le juge, I–
$GEN_053_07x09_03_02
I will give you the chance to be honest with me. Whose bones did you store in your shed, and where did you get them?
$GEN_053_07x09_03_03
…
$GEN_053_07x09_03_04
Pardon?
$GEN_053_07x09_03_05
I bought them at a street market in the 6th Section.
$GEN_053_07x09_03_06
Liar!
$GEN_053_07x09_03_07
How do the vendors store the bones?
$GEN_053_07x09_03_08
In wooden boxes, like those used for vegetables.
$GEN_053_07x09_03_09
They are rather small. A whole human jaw would surely not fit inside one.
$GEN_053_07x09_03_10
…
$GEN_053_07x09_03_11
You will not admit your guilt?
$GEN_053_07x09_03_12
All I ever wanted was to make beautiful cutlery. Beautiful, and with a soul.
$GEN_053_03x06_04_QTitle
How many bones do you use every month?
$GEN_053_03x06_04_00
How many bones do you use every month?
$GEN_053_03x06_04_01
I’m slow, and crafting takes time. Before you begin the carving process, you need to prepare the raw material. First I soak the bones in sour milk so that–
$GEN_053_03x06_04_02
Answer the question.
$GEN_053_03x06_04_03
Part of what you found in the shed probably wouldn’t be much use – it’s not possible to spot the cracks in them immediately. I think those materials would last for no longer than a month.
$GEN_053_03x06_04_04
Then what?
$GEN_053_03x06_04_05
After using about half of what I have, I’d have to go to the street market for more.
$GEN_053_03x06_04_06
Or to the cemetery with a shovel!
$GEN_053_03x06_04_07
Do you still refuse to admit it? Were you killing people or looking for bones in catacombs?
$GEN_053_03x06_04_08
Old bones are not the best carving material.
$GEN_053_03x06_04_09
Should we treat that as a confession of murder?
$GEN_053_03x06_04_10
What are you talking about? I’ve not killed anyone! I bought bones at a street market.
$GEN_053_04x07_05_QTitle
Who do you sell your merchandise to?
$GEN_053_04x07_05_00
Who do you sell your merchandise to?
$GEN_053_04x07_05_01
Usually to wealthier Citizens. My craftsmanship is incredibly detailed. I would even dare to call it art.
$GEN_053_04x07_05_02
To hell with that kind of art!
$GEN_053_04x07_05_03
Besides, handles made of bone are impressive.
$GEN_053_04x07_05_04
Stop before I throw up on the first row…
$GEN_053_04x07_05_05
Do you sell a lot of your products?
$GEN_053_04x07_05_06
Quite a lot. Enough to live without fear. Once I sold a whole set to an English diplomat. The bones I process are as white as snow, so I easily convinced him it was made of ivory. I earned several times as much as I do when selling a regular set to French Citizens.
$GEN_053_04x07_05_07
Should I also add fraud to the list of charges against you?
$GEN_053_04x07_05_08
If it stops you talking nonsense about me killing people, I will admit to deceit.
$GEN_053_07x08_06_QTitle
Call in the witness, Claudine Plouffe.
$GEN_053_07x08_06_00
Call in the witness, Claudine Plouffe.
$GEN_053_07x08_06_02
Claudine Plouffe?
$GEN_053_07x08_06_03
Correct.
$GEN_053_WIT_00_A_QTitle
How did you recognise a human bone in the workshop?
$GEN_053_WIT_00_A_00
How did you recognise a human bone in the workshop?
$GEN_053_WIT_00_A_01
It was a tibia. An untrained eye could mistake it for an animal bone, but they differ in thickness and shape. Excuse the simplification, but the human tibia usually has a more triangular cross-section.
$GEN_053_WIT_00_A_02
And you had no doubts?
$GEN_053_WIT_00_A_03
Monsieur le juge, I have seen enough bones in my life. This one could as well have been my own.
$GEN_053_WIT_00_A_04
Was it old?
$GEN_053_WIT_00_A_05
Are you asking about the time of its owner’s death? It is hard to say given that the bone had been carved.
$GEN_053_WIT_00_A_06
Could you attempt an estimation? It is important.
$GEN_053_WIT_00_A_07
If I were to guess, I would say that an old bone, one taken from a grave, would not be good carving material. It would be too brittle and yellowed.
$GEN_053_WIT_00_A_08
Are you sure?
$GEN_053_WIT_00_A_09
I have never dug up a corpse, so I can only repeat what my intuition tells me.
$GEN_053_WIT_00_B_QTitle
Please describe Citizen Adnet’s behaviour during your visit.
$GEN_053_WIT_00_B_00
Please describe Citizen Adnet’s behaviour during your visit.
$GEN_053_WIT_00_B_01
Now that you ask, monsieur le juge, I remember that he was carving something.
$GEN_053_WIT_00_B_02
Did he speak to you or encourage you to buy something?
$GEN_053_WIT_00_B_03
After greeting me, he did not pay that much attention to me. I was fine with that, as I truly loathe high-pressure salesmen.
$GEN_053_WIT_00_B_04
Did you ask any questions?
$GEN_053_WIT_00_B_05
I asked about the price. I don’t remember it exactly, but it struck me as low for the delicate precision of his workmanship.
$GEN_053_WIT_00_B_06
Then you saw the human bone?
$GEN_053_WIT_00_B_07
That is correct. I first thought that I was imagining it, but then I picked it up and turned it over in my hand…
$GEN_053_WIT_01_A_QTitle
Do you know the accused?
$GEN_053_WIT_01_A_00
Do you know the accused?
$GEN_053_WIT_01_A_01
Yes, he often came to buy bones from me.
$GEN_053_WIT_01_A_02
Did you sell him animal bones?
$GEN_053_WIT_01_A_03
I… well…
$GEN_053_WIT_01_A_04
Citizen?
$GEN_053_WIT_01_A_05
Animal, yes, but I don’t know much about bones. Sometimes I got the feeling there was something strange about what the butcher brought us…
$GEN_053_WIT_01_A_06
As though it was not taken from an animal?
$GEN_053_WIT_01_A_07
I don’t know, just strange.
$GEN_053_WIT_01_A_08
How frequent were the butcher’s deliveries?
$GEN_053_WIT_01_A_09
Not often. Once, maybe twice a month.
$GEN_053_WIT_01_B_QTitle
Did you ever ask the accused why he needed those bones?
$GEN_053_WIT_01_B_00
Did you ever ask the accused why he needed those bones?
$GEN_053_WIT_01_B_01
I did. He said he’d make cutlery from them. I just tapped my temple like he was crazy and went back to work.
$GEN_053_WIT_01_B_02
So you found it strange?
$GEN_053_WIT_01_B_03
Yes, but these are strange times. People can get used to anything.
$GEN_053_WIT_01_B_04
Was Citizen Adnet carefully picking the bones he bought? As though he were looking for something special?
$GEN_053_WIT_01_B_05
Yes, he often stood by the basket and rummaged about. But sometimes when he was in a hurry he’d just buy whole baskets.
$GEN_053_WIT_01_B_06
How often did he come for bones?
$GEN_053_WIT_01_B_07
He used to come often, but I haven’t seen that much of him in the last six months. He said that he found another supplier.
$GEN_053_WIT_01_B_08
Why not kill a few undertakers too, just in case?
$GEN_053_WIT_01_B_09
Did he mention a name?
$GEN_053_WIT_01_B_10
I didn’t care to ask.
$GEN_053_WIT_01_B_12
Who was the other supplier the witness mentioned?
$GEN_053_WIT_01_B_13
There was nobody, monsieur le juge. Recently, I have not had that much money and did not want people to know that business is not good…
$GEN_053_WIT_01_B_14
