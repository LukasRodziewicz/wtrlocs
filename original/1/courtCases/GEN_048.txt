	The daughter of Jean and Marie Picque died immediately after birth. The father testified that he heard the child crying loudly and intensely. Yet, when he entered the room occupied by his wife, one servant, and the midwife, his daughter was not breathing.
$GEN_048_DOC_01_01
	The doctor called by Mr and Mrs Picque arrived the next day. He noticed <a name="4" class="hidden">strangulation marks</a> on the infant’s neck, and he was the one who informed the Guard. The investigator was unable to interrogate the parents, as they were both in shock and filled with despair.
$GEN_048_DOC_01_02
	We found numerous signs of the birth in the untidy bedroom. Among them were <a name="5" class="hidden">forceps</a> left by the midwife, who, as we learned from the servant, left in a great hurry. It looked as though she were escaping.
$GEN_048_DOC_01_03
	We managed to establish the midwife’s identity as Claudine Sessier. People say she has bad luck when it comes to delivering girls, as most of her infant female patients did not make it. We decided to arrest her as a suspect. Investigators found an open <a name="7" class="hidden">Bible</a> on her kitchen table.

Evidence:
$GEN_048_DOC_01_05
	Sessier’s Bible is an old, cheap, and worn-out edition. She had underlined numerous excerpts in pencil.
$GEN_048_OnStart_00
Midwife Sessier?
$GEN_048_OnStart_01
Aye, that’s me.
$GEN_048_OnStart_02
Did you strangle Mr and Mrs Picque’s child?
$GEN_048_OnStart_03
I had to, monsieur le juge. Unfortunately, the child was born a girl.
$GEN_048_OnStart_04
You will burn in hell!
$GEN_048_OnStart_05
What do you mean?
$GEN_048_OnStart_06
You’re a man, you wouldn’t understand. I just want women to stop suffering.
$GEN_048_OnStart_07
Then why do you strangle them?
$GEN_048_OnStart_08
As I said, you wouldn’t understand.
$GEN_048_OnStart_09
She’s crazy!
$GEN_048_OnGuilty_00
Citizen Sessier, you fill me with disgust, and it is with great relief that I sentence you to death.
$GEN_048_OnGuilty_01
That’s not enough! Have her quartered!
$GEN_048_OnGuilty_02
I will sleep better knowing that she is not practising her profession.
$GEN_048_OnNotGuilty_00
Citizen Sessier, I find you not guilty. You may go.
$GEN_048_OnNotGuilty_01
The judge is in league with that murderous witch!
$GEN_048_OnNotGuilty_02
Guillotine the Judge!
$GEN_048_OnNotGuilty_03
This is betrayal!
$GEN_048_OnNotGuilty_04
If she continues to practise her profession, the deaths will be on you.
$GEN_048_02x04_00_QTitle
Was the child born alive?
$GEN_048_02x04_00_00
Was the child born alive?
$GEN_048_02x04_00_01
Yes, monsieur le juge.
$GEN_048_02x04_00_02
Did you strangle it with your own hands?
$GEN_048_02x04_00_03
No, I… I have a special bead necklace. It would be faster if I just broke their necks, but I’m not able to do it.
$GEN_048_02x04_00_04
I put forward a proposal to immediately conclude this interrogation… with a death sentence.
$GEN_048_02x04_00_05
Not yet. Citizen, how could you do something so terrible?
$GEN_048_02x04_00_06
I do it for them, monsieur le juge, not for myself. I have suffered enough and they will not have to.
$GEN_048_01x07_01_QTitle
Do you believe in God, woman?
$GEN_048_01x07_01_00
Do you believe in God, woman?
$GEN_048_01x07_01_01
No, monsieur le juge.
$GEN_048_01x07_01_02
What about the Bible in your house?
$GEN_048_01x07_01_03
The Bible is not a holy book, but a manual for men so that they can ruin our lives!
$GEN_048_01x07_01_04
Explain.
$GEN_048_01x07_01_05
The Letter to the Ephesians, for example, instructs, “Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands as you do to the Lord, for the husband is the head of the wife.” Men hear that in church and then treat women worse than animals!
$GEN_048_01x07_01_06
But are you not doing worse by killing them?
$GEN_048_01x07_01_07
I’m helping them.
$GEN_048_01x07_01_08
How exactly?
$GEN_048_01x07_01_09
Men are dying in the war, so there are fewer and fewer of them, so women have to fight over them. If there are fewer women, men will finally begin to respect them!
$GEN_048_01x07_01_10
That woman is possessed!
$GEN_048_01x07_01_11
Did men not respect you?
$GEN_048_01x07_01_12
My father gave me to a man. He beat me for eight years until he finally drunk himself to death.
$GEN_048_01x07_01_13
The Revolution stands against religious superstition. You do not have to.
$GEN_048_01x07_01_14
Does it? You fight for “brotherhood”, but you don’t care for your sisters.
$GEN_048_02x05_02_QTitle
Why did you leave the Picque’s house in such a hurry?
$GEN_048_02x05_02_00
Why did you leave the Picque’s house in such a hurry?
$GEN_048_02x05_02_01
The child was dead. There was nothing more I could help them with.
$GEN_048_02x05_02_02
Did you charge them for the birth?
$GEN_048_02x05_02_03
No, I couldn’t.
$GEN_048_02x05_02_04
Why?
$GEN_048_02x05_02_05
…
$GEN_048_02x05_02_06
Let me ask you again – why did you not take money from Mr and Mrs Picque?
$GEN_048_02x05_02_07
Stop tormenting me! I didn’t do it for myself. I just want other women to have a better life than me! If there are fewer of us than men, our thousand-year nightmare will come to an end!
$GEN_048_02x05_02_08
That tiny girl’s whole, short life was a nightmare.
