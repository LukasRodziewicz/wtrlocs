Isaac Medelsheim, a 53-year-old Jewish widower, runs three Parisian inns and grants loans for a living. His daughter, 16-year-old Esther Medelsheim, assists him. The tradesman describes himself as a zealous <a name="2" class="hidden">supporter of the Revolution</a>, as he believes that through it Jews will finally be granted the same rights as the other Citizens of France.
$GEN_021_DOC_01_01
Due to the current shortages of food supplies across the city, his primary source of income is usury. Medelsheim is suspected of having stolen military supplies with the intention of selling them in his inns.
$GEN_021_DOC_01_02
The alleged crime was witnessed by Count Jean-Philippe de Braux, one of Medelsheim’s debtors. He notified the authorities that late in the evening on Saturday, 12th September, he watched Isaac Medelsheim personally managing the <a name="4" class="hidden">unloading of vehicles</a> that belonged to his cousin Herz Medelsheim, as they were standing in front of his <a name="5" class="hidden">warehouse</a>. Everyone knows that Herz only provides supplies for the French army, and that his managers are frequent guests at Isaac’s inns.
$GEN_021_DOC_01_03
The investigators found <a name="6" class="hidden">military chests</a> stamped by Herz Medelsheim’s company in Isaac’s warehouse. Their contents – wine, dried horse meat, and flour – were not mentioned in the <a name="7" class="hidden">inventory</a>. They appeared, however, in the waybills of the garrison in Reims. The records show that Esther Medelsheim is responsible for the inventory.
$GEN_021_DOC_01_04
Isaac Medelsheim was immediately arrested and accused of stealing from the French army and acting against the best interests of France.

$GEN_021_OnStart_00
Jewish leech!
$GEN_021_OnStart_01
Kill that bourgeois!
$GEN_021_OnStart_02
Please introduce yourself.
$GEN_021_OnStart_03
Isaac Medelsheim, monsieur le juge.
$GEN_021_OnStart_04
You are accused of stealing the property of the French army and attempting to sell it.
$GEN_021_OnStart_05
What theft, monsieur le juge, what crime?!
$GEN_021_OnStart_06
We have a witness who saw everything with his own eyes.
$GEN_021_OnStart_07
This is slander, monsieur le juge, and provocation made up by Count de Braux! He owes me money and doesn’t want to pay it back!
$GEN_021_OnStart_08
The military chests found in your warehouse filled with supplies intended for the garrison in Reims are quite conclusive evidence against you.
$GEN_021_OnStart_09
I can explain!
$GEN_021_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Citizen Isaac Medelsheim to the guillotine! Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_021_OnGuilty_01
Let’s hope that our soldiers finally have something to eat.
$GEN_021_OnGuilty_02
Finally!
$GEN_021_OnGuilty_03
Send all the bourgeoisie to the guillotine!
$GEN_021_OnNotGuilty_00
The judgement for Isaac Medelsheim is… not guilty! Take the defendant away.
$GEN_021_OnNotGuilty_01
I formally object to the verdict!
$GEN_021_OnNotGuilty_02
They let a thief walk free!
$GEN_021_OnNotGuilty_03
He’s a Counter-Revolutionary!
$GEN_021_OnNotGuilty_04
The judge was bought!
$GEN_021_01x04_00_QTitle
How many employees work in your warehouse?
$GEN_021_01x04_00_00
How many employees work in your warehouse?
$GEN_021_01x04_00_01
Five, but they are all sluggards and idlers.
$GEN_021_01x04_00_02
How can you explain that even though you have five people working for you and you are Jewish, you were personally unloading chests on the Sabbath?
$GEN_021_01x04_00_03
Herz’s manager, Jacob, ordered him to quickly unload the chests because he wanted to hit the road. I rushed to the warehouse, but it was late and none of those good-for-nothings were working.
$GEN_021_01x04_00_04
So you decided to neglect your own religion?
$GEN_021_01x04_00_05
The Sabbath is the Sabbath and business is business. I could have refused, but then I would have lost money. Times are hard.
$GEN_021_01x04_00_06
So you did not arrange the whole thing to avoid any witnesses?
$GEN_021_01x04_00_07
Witnesses? Of what? The unloading?
$GEN_021_01x04_00_08
Of the theft of military supplies.
$GEN_021_01x04_00_09
There were no military supplies, this is all a huge misunderstanding.
$GEN_021_01x04_00_10
The lying rat!
$GEN_021_05x06_01_QTitle
Why did the investigators find full military chests in your warehouse?
$GEN_021_05x06_01_00
Why did the investigators find full military chests in your warehouse?
$GEN_021_05x06_01_01
I bought those chests empty. Herz sells high quality military chests for the same I could pay for inferior equivalents. How could I not buy them?
$GEN_021_05x06_01_02
Is that even legal? Does the Army not need them?
$GEN_021_05x06_01_03
I have no idea. If Herz sells them, it must be fine.
$GEN_021_05x06_01_04
You did not think to ask?
$GEN_021_05x06_01_05
Who am I, an investigator? He assured me it was fine.
$GEN_021_05x06_01_06
Insolent bourgeois!
$GEN_021_05x06_01_07
Jews always lie!
$GEN_021_05x06_01_08
Silence!
$GEN_021_03x06_02_QTitle
Why were the chests filled with goods…?
$GEN_021_03x06_02_00
Why were the chests filled with goods listed in the waybills as prepared for the French Army?
$GEN_021_03x06_02_01
Our Army is not the only party buying wine and dried meat. The chests were filled with goods purchased from my supplier, Marcel Rozier. He can confirm it.
$GEN_021_03x06_02_02
Marcel Rozier cannot confirm anything. As you probably already know, he was found dead last week.
$GEN_021_03x06_02_03
Monsieur le juge, this is the first time I’ve heard about it. What a–
$GEN_021_03x06_02_04
How convenient it is to blame a dead man.
$GEN_021_03x06_02_05
Maybe to you, but I’ve lost my main supplier.
$GEN_021_03x06_02_06
You did not know about Rozier’s death?
$GEN_021_03x06_02_07
Not at all. The whole thing was plotted by my debtors. They want to get rid of me!
$GEN_021_03x06_02_08
As they should.
$GEN_021_03x06_02_09
It’s a plot hatched by my debtors, and I demand justice!
$GEN_021_06x07_03_QTitle
You did not include the goods stored in the chests from Herz in your inventory…
$GEN_021_06x07_03_00
You have not included the goods stored in the chests from Herz in your inventory to conceal the fact that they came from military supplies, am I right?
$GEN_021_06x07_03_01
I purchased them legally! Monsieur le juge, you can check it yourself, the books are carefully kept. This must be a mistake.
$GEN_021_06x07_03_02
The court has checked. The goods are not mentioned in the inventory, which leads to even bigger suspicions, as the books were indeed neatly kept in the past.
$GEN_021_06x07_03_03
My daughter Esther is responsible for the books. She has been extremely ill recently, and probably just forgot.
$GEN_021_06x07_03_04
Maybe you did not tell her about the goods because you did not want her involved in your crime?
$GEN_021_06x07_03_05
If you were no thief, the girl wouldn’t have been left alone!
$GEN_021_06x07_03_06
There was no crime. She must have planned to write it down later.
$GEN_021_06x07_03_07
I’ll stand up and kick his arse, I swear!
$GEN_021_02x03_04_QTitle
What do you think about the Revolution?
$GEN_021_02x03_04_00
What do you think about the Revolution?
$GEN_021_02x03_04_01
How could I not support it when the kind Citizens of France want to grant Jews the same rights they have?
$GEN_021_02x03_04_02
Then why are you harming the Revolution by stealing military supplies?
$GEN_021_02x03_04_03
I offered my own money for the Revolution, monsieur le juge. Ask the friends of Mr Robespierre, Mr Joseph Fouché and Mr Antoine Simon, they will confirm it.
$GEN_021_02x03_04_04
You paid to pretend to be one of us.
$GEN_021_02x03_04_05
People like me do not benefit from supporting the Revolution.
$GEN_021_02x03_04_06
Benefit? So you’re saying that you supported the people to gain money?
$GEN_021_02x03_04_07
No, no, I can expl–
$GEN_021_02x03_04_08
Give him to us, we’ll decapitate him even without a guillotine.
$GEN_021_02x03_04_09
“Gain money”? If I really stole those articles, which I did not, and sold them in my inns, I would not even get back what I gave to Mr Robespierre’s friends!
$GEN_021_07x08_05_QTitle
Call in the witness, Citizen Esther Medelsheim.
$GEN_021_07x08_05_00
Call in the witness, Citizen Esther Medelsheim.
$GEN_021_07x08_05_02
Esther Medelsheim, the daughter of Isaac Medelsheim.
$GEN_021_07x08_05_03
Are you able to testify? I can see that you are unwell.
$GEN_021_07x08_05_04
Yes, I will manage.
$GEN_021_05x07_06_QTitle
Who is responsible for managing the inventory?
$GEN_021_05x07_06_00
Who is responsible for managing the inventory?
$GEN_021_05x07_06_01
My daughter Esther, monsieur le juge.
$GEN_021_05x07_06_02
Is she the only person that can access it?
$GEN_021_05x07_06_03
I take a glance at it sometimes, but I would never get my daughter in trouble!
$GEN_021_05x07_06_04
So you do not look over your own books?
$GEN_021_05x07_06_05
I trust her as I do myself.
$GEN_021_05x07_06_06
However, this time the goods were not noted down.
$GEN_021_05x07_06_07
It is a trivial thing.
$GEN_021_05x07_06_08
Your execution will be a trivial thing.
$GEN_021_03x05_07_QTitle
Why were the vehicles belonging to the main supplier of the French army…?
$GEN_021_03x05_07_00
Why were the vehicles belonging to the main supplier of the French army, Herz Medelsheim, standing in front of your warehouse?
$GEN_021_03x05_07_01
They were getting ready to continue on their journey. The managers of my cousin Herz like to stop at my inn whenever their route allows it.
$GEN_021_03x05_07_02
And it just so happened that they were delivering the same kind of goods found in the military chests, that were also matching the military records, and were not included in your inventory?
$GEN_021_03x05_07_03
I know it sounds strange, but–
$GEN_021_03x05_07_04
Rip his lying tongue out!
$GEN_021_WIT_00_A_QTitle
Describe your duties for your father’s company.
$GEN_021_WIT_00_A_00
Describe your duties for your father’s company.
$GEN_021_WIT_00_A_01
I am responsible for the inventory and the accounts of our debtors.
$GEN_021_WIT_00_A_02
Why did you not list in the inventory the goods that were stored in the military chests?
$GEN_021_WIT_00_A_03
Monsieur le juge, since my health declined, I have neglected my duties and unfortunately forgot to include those goods in the books.
$GEN_021_WIT_00_A_04
Are you too weak to hold a pen?
$GEN_021_WIT_00_A_05
I get tired quickly, light-headed… It is hard for me to work.
$GEN_021_WIT_00_A_06
Or maybe you did not want to be part of your father’s crimes?
$GEN_021_WIT_00_A_07
The food was delivered by our regular supplier, Marcel Rozier. I did not note the goods down, and that is my fault alone.
$GEN_021_WIT_01_A_QTitle
What do you know about the charges brought against your father?
$GEN_021_WIT_01_A_00
What do you know about the charges brought against your father?
$GEN_021_WIT_01_A_01
They are based on the lies of Count de Braux! He owes my father 400,000 francs and does not want to pay it back! But you probably know that, monsieur le juge, since you two know each other well!
$GEN_021_WIT_01_A_02
I call the witness to order!
$GEN_021_WIT_01_A_03
Count de Braux himself referred to his relationship with monsieur le juge directly before the trial!
$GEN_021_WIT_01_A_04
The Judge is in bed with Counter-Revolutionaries!
$GEN_021_WIT_01_A_05
Are you able prove those insinuations?
$GEN_021_WIT_01_A_06
Unfortunately nothing more than my own words and a strong belief that I am in a place where justice must prevail. My father is not guilty. He legally purchased both the chests and the goods!
$GEN_021_WIT_01_A_07
Lead the witness out!
