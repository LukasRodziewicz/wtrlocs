Alain Bras, a 37-year-old widower, is employed as a carter in one of the warehouses at the Grenoüillere port. He has been working there for two years now. The accused is famous for his <a name="1" class="hidden">bold driving style</a> that enables him to deliver goods faster than his colleagues.
$GEN_041_DOC_01_01
Bras has been accused of killing five-year-old Marcel Gide with his cart. The boy died shortly after the accident due to extensive head injuries. Bras is accused of not only running over the boy, but also for not stopping to help him.
$GEN_041_DOC_01_02
According to witnesses, Bras had been seen <a name="2" class="hidden">driving his cart</a> at ridiculously high speeds on <a name="3" class="hidden">rue du Croissant</a>, where Marcel's body was found. An examination of the body left no room for doubt – only a speeding cart could damage it to such an extent.
$GEN_041_DOC_01_03
Bras was detained an hour and a half after the discovery of the body. He was waiting for his goods to be unloaded in front of The Merry Wolf inn. The accused was <a name="4" class="hidden">completely drunk</a>, and could barely stand on his own. The back wheels of his cart were <a name="5" class="hidden">covered in fresh blood</a>.

The devastated mother of Marcel, Jeanne Gide, demands severe punishment for the murderer.
$GEN_041_OnStart_00
Citizen, what is your name?
$GEN_041_OnStart_01
My name is Alain Bras.
$GEN_041_OnStart_02
You are accused of causing a fatal accident at the junction of rue du Gros Chenet and rue du Croissant. You have the blood of a five-year-old on your hands.
$GEN_041_OnStart_03
I swear I didn’t run over that little boy!
$GEN_041_OnStart_04
Not showing repentance or a willingness to cooperate are not mitigating factors.
$GEN_041_OnStart_05
Don’t waste our time, he’s guilty!
$GEN_041_OnGuilty_00
I sentence Citizen Alain Bras to death by guillotine! Take the convict away.
$GEN_041_OnGuilty_01
An eye for an eye!
$GEN_041_OnGuilty_02
A lenient sentence for what he did.
$GEN_041_OnPrison_00
I sentence Citizen Alain Bras to prison! Lead the condemned out.
$GEN_041_OnPrison_01
I hope he rots there!
$GEN_041_OnPrison_02
He should lose his head!
$GEN_041_OnPrison_03
So, the parents have lost a child, yet that scum lives? It does not seem fair.
$GEN_041_OnNotGuilty_00
The judgement for Alain Bras is… not guilty! Take the defendant away.
$GEN_041_OnNotGuilty_01
Meanwhile, the child’s mother is crying her eyes out! What happened to justice?!
$GEN_041_OnNotGuilty_02
I cannot agree. He is guilty, everyone knows that!
$GEN_041_02x05_00_QTitle
There was blood on the back wheels of your cart. Where did it come from?
$GEN_041_02x05_00_00
There was blood on the back wheels of your cart. Where did it come from?
$GEN_041_02x05_00_01
It was from a dog. I ran over one near The Merry Wolf.
$GEN_041_02x05_00_02
Really? Everything indicates that it was in fact the blood of the minor who was run over by the accused.
$GEN_041_02x05_00_03
Impossible! I’d know if a kid fell under my wheels.
$GEN_041_02x05_00_04
A five-year-old child is much the same size as a large dog. Maybe you were not looking carefully?
$GEN_041_02x05_00_05
No way, I heard the barking.
$GEN_041_02x05_00_06
He was so steeped in wine that he wouldn’t know a child from a cow!
$GEN_041_02x03_01_QTitle
Did you ride through rue du Croissant?
$GEN_041_02x03_01_00
Did you ride through rue du Croissant?
$GEN_041_02x03_01_01
Sure I did. I had to turn from rue du Gros Chenet to get the goods to the inn.
$GEN_041_02x03_01_02
And I believe you did not take the time to sightsee?
$GEN_041_02x03_01_03
You mean I was rushing? Of course I was! Time was scarce, clients were waiting, no time to lose.
$GEN_041_02x03_01_04
No time to lose, because…?
$GEN_041_02x03_01_05
Well… because the goods have to be delivered on time, right?
$GEN_041_02x03_01_06
So you risked having an accident?
$GEN_041_02x03_01_07
The thirsty fellow rushed to the bottle.
$GEN_041_02x03_01_08
So you admit to driving as fast as the horses would let you?
$GEN_041_02x03_01_09
Yeah, sure, but it doesn’t make me a killer. There are other carters in Paris, it could have been one before or after I passed.
$GEN_041_02x03_01_10
Right, pin this on someone else, you bastard!
$GEN_041_03x04_02_QTitle
How much did you drink before starting your route that Friday?
$GEN_041_03x04_02_00
How much did you drink before starting your route that Friday?
$GEN_041_03x04_02_01
One small glass, monsieur le juge.
$GEN_041_03x04_02_02
So when you arrived at rue du Croissant, you were already under the influence of alcohol?
$GEN_041_03x04_02_03
My friend, I’m a big chap. One glass of wine is like water to me. I was driving sober, like always.
$GEN_041_03x04_02_04
I bet he’s always three sheets to the wind when he’s jumping on that cart.
$GEN_041_03x04_02_05
Yet you were completely drunk when the authorities found you outside The Merry Wolf.
$GEN_041_03x04_02_06
It was the end of my route, and the kind host brought me a bottle of brandy. Of course, I immediately dealt with it. I’d finished work, right?
$GEN_041_03x04_02_07
He drank to silence his conscience!
$GEN_041_03x04_02_08
Were you in a hurry to have a drink after a rough day’s work?
$GEN_041_03x04_02_09
I mean, yeah, that's nor… Wait, no, nothing like that.
$GEN_041_01x02_03_QTitle
You probably would not call yourself a careful carter, would you?
$GEN_041_01x02_03_00
You probably would not call yourself a careful carter, would you?
$GEN_041_01x02_03_01
I have to arrive at a certain place at a certain time. That’s the job, and it’s not for slowcoaches.
$GEN_041_01x02_03_02
Are all carters rushing at such a speed that they do not notice children playing in the streets?
$GEN_041_01x02_03_03
I didn’t run over anyone! It could have been any carter in Paris.
$GEN_041_01x04_04_QTitle
Do you drive better after alcohol?
$GEN_041_01x04_04_00
Do you drive better after alcohol?
$GEN_041_01x04_04_01
Dunno, but you should have a glass on an empty stomach for health. Without it, your hands are too shaky to hold the reins properly.
$GEN_041_01x04_04_02
Have you ever tried to drive without it?
$GEN_041_01x04_04_03
Hey, what are you suggesting? I’m no drunkard!
$GEN_041_01x04_04_04
Look at him, all proud!
$GEN_041_01x04_04_05
Enough with that chatter, behead him already!
$GEN_041_02x04_05_QTitle
Do you drink a lot?
$GEN_041_02x04_05_00
Do you drink a lot?
$GEN_041_02x04_05_01
A tot more since my wife died, though no more than other carters. It comes with the job.
$GEN_041_02x04_05_02
So you often drive intoxicated?
$GEN_041_02x04_05_03
They’d kick me out if I did! I have no more than a glass or two before the job starts. The party only starts after I finish working.
$GEN_041_02x04_05_04
No more than two? Would you like to be driven by a drunk carter?
$GEN_041_02x04_05_05
What do I care? I’m too poor to be driven, anyway.
$GEN_041_02x04_05_06
He doesn’t care.

He ran over a dog.

He was hurrying to see his family.

He had a bet with a friend.
