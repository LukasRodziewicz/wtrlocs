Disorder shall be suppressed with the brutal strength of our truth. No turning back now!
$G_SP_01_AGGR_02
The guillotine would almost be a pardon, such a hideous deed demands torture! Should we torture him?!
$G_SP_01_AGGR_03
Where there is crime, there must be punishment! And we shall dish it out, oh yes! Even the convict’s ancestors shall feel the cold edge of the guillotine slicing through their necks!
$G_SP_01_MANI_01
Future generations will remember that we were not cowards! They will remember us delivering punishment for such hideous crimes!
$G_SP_01_MANI_02
Anyone stepping outside the boundaries of Revolutionary law has only themselves to blame! Only themselves!
$G_SP_01_MANI_03
There are no shades of grey to crime, only guilt or innocence.
$G_SP_01_JOKE_01
Quick! The reaper would like to have a word with the convict about this terrible crime.
$G_SP_01_JOKE_02
For this convict here, killing was as easy as breathing. That is how guillotining is to us!
$G_SP_01_JOKE_03
The convict was curious about the taste of crime, now we shall give him his desert!
$G_SP_01_HUMI_01
Themis spoke through your mouths. She calls out “Justice!” And we shall hear her voice!
$G_SP_01_HUMI_02
As a judge, I merely carry out the will of the Republic.
$G_SP_01_HUMI_03
We can be a merciful nation, but we shall not forget that a terrible crime was committed.
$G_SP_02_AGGR_01
Murderers, traitors, deceivers – you have to eliminate them, or innocent lives will be in danger!
$G_SP_02_AGGR_02
We shall behead another monster feeding on injustice!
$G_SP_02_AGGR_03
This individual spits in the face of Themis and the people. Justice will not accept such insults!
$G_SP_02_MANI_01
These offenders want to go back to the old ways! They defend them!
$G_SP_02_MANI_02
Will you just stand there and allow criminals to tell you what to do?
$G_SP_02_MANI_03
Do not listen to them when they say you cannot read. Listen to them when they beg for mercy at the guillotine!
$G_SP_02_JOKE_01
Come, let the accused have a word with the guillotine!
$G_SP_02_JOKE_02
Today we have a convict who, as they all say, is innocent!
$G_SP_02_JOKE_03
Give a round of applause for the play <i>“Killed for Nothing”</i>!
$G_SP_02_HUMI_02
We are not only mourning the victim’s, but the convict’s soul as well. But do not mistake our compassion for weakness.
$G_SP_02_HUMI_03
The criminals belong in the grave. Only then can we build a better future!
$G_SP_02_HUMI_04
By passing this sentence we are making our streets safer. I am not mourning the one being guillotined, but us, his victims!
$G_SP_03_AGGR_01
You have gained power in France. Now spill the blood of those who oppose the Republic!
$G_SP_03_AGGR_02
These criminals think that because we are tolerant, we are also weak! That is enough!
$G_SP_03_AGGR_03
Only death awaits the enemies of France!
$G_SP_03_MANI_01
We are not worthy of that freedom if we let the old system and rotten morality poison our country!
$G_SP_03_MANI_02
The reign of the previous rulers, whose goal was to bring injustice to the people, ends with their swift deaths.
$G_SP_03_MANI_04
Future generations will remember that we were not cowards! It needs to be done!
$G_SP_03_JOKE_01
Has anyone seen the executioner? Find me that drunkard, or I will have to hire someone else!
$G_SP_03_JOKE_02
Chop chop, no time to waste!
$G_SP_03_JOKE_03
Kill this filthy rat and let us get something to eat at last!
$G_SP_03_HUMI_01
It is you, the people, who are in charge here.
$G_SP_03_HUMI_02
Citizens, we must return to work so we may build our new France! For the nation!
$G_SP_03_HUMI_04
The old system has to fall. There is no other way. You are the sovereigns now!
