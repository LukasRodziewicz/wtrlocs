Gobel is currently immune. He has Hébert’s support and the common folk appreciate what he did.

He claims to be fully devoted to the rule of reason and to rejecting everything that is wrong in the clergy. Clever.
$DIAL_H_02_02_08_003_DANTON
Only Robespierre can stop him now. And he will if that rule of reason begins to cross the line.
$DIAL_H_02_02_08_004_RAMEL
Or if they publish their list of 73. I am sure Robespierre’s associates were also listed there.
$DIAL_H_02_02_08_005_DANTON
Hébert’s stupidity and ambition are what make him contend with Robespierre. He has long dreamt about this power. As have we all.
$DIAL_H_02_02_08_006_RAMEL
Hébert will lose without the friends he would destroy by revealing the list. And without his support from the clergy, Gobel is a weak ally.
$DIAL_H_02_02_08_007_DANTON
Yes, but Hébert is too proud to see that. I know him well. He heard the calling and will not let go. We must convince him that fighting Robespierre alone means death.
$DIAL_H_02_02_08_008_JUDGE
And what if he does not let go?
$DIAL_H_02_02_08_009_DANTON
Then we will all die the moment the crusade against the 73 starts. Hébert and his rule of reason will die next at the hand of Robespierre. The Incorruptible will take control of Paris.
$DIAL_H_02_02_08_010_JUDGE
We must introduce Hébert to someone else with the potential to have a power base. Someone who will be a much stronger tool against Robespierre than Gobel. I think that I have the perfect candidate…
