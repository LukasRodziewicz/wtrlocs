Father, was Uncle Raymond really involved in Frédéric’s death?

Everything points to that.

How could he…?

It would appear that he has been on Renard’s leash for a long time. Everyone has a master, even if he or she has not yet learned their name.

On a leash?
$DIAL_H_02_01_07_V1_006_GRANDFATHER
Many years ago, when the Renards began to take over one stall after another, I refused to sell mine. Three men came and tried to intimidate me. Bruno was with me that day. He grabbed a stick, determined to drive them away, and almost killed one in a fit of rage.

That's when Raymond came and offered for Bruno to be banished instead of executed. And it looks like the Renards simply seized the opportunity and, with his hands, took what the long wanted from us. Our stall was lost, and Bruno, the family defender, left the city. The Renards won.

I always told you that you should keep an eye on them, but you ignored my warnings, thinking that I was just a grumpy old man.
$DIAL_H_02_01_07_V1_009_JUDGE
They will pay for it. I will do anything…
$DIAL_H_02_01_07_V1_010_ELDERSON
How? Do you really want more blood?
$DIAL_H_02_01_07_V1_011_GRANDFATHER
The Renards have to pay! What good are revolutions and rebellions if we cannot demand justice?
