How are you feeling today, Bernard?
$DIAL_H_03_01_01_002_BERNARD
What do you see?
$DIAL_H_03_01_01_003_JUDGE
Pardon?
$DIAL_H_03_01_01_004_BERNARD
I asked you what you see.
$DIAL_H_03_01_01_005_JUDGE
You, my son.
$DIAL_H_03_01_01_006_BERNARD
No. You can see a monster. Mutilated, humiliated, and stripped of his dreams.
$DIAL_H_03_01_01_007_JUDGE
That is not true. There is much that still awaits you…
$DIAL_H_03_01_01_008_BERNARD
What is it that awaits me?! A career? Look at me! I’ll never be able to play again! You wanted that, didn’t you? Say it!
$DIAL_H_03_01_01_009_JUDGE
Never.
$DIAL_H_03_01_01_010_BERNARD
I don’t believe you! And I never will again. You used to say that you would take care of us, but nobody can stop this madness, this terrible Revolution. Or this damned family, with its corpses rising from their graves to harass the living.
$DIAL_H_03_01_01_011_BERNARD
Or maybe it is a sign of the times? What about the people who were decapitated because of you? Will they also return to kill us? Maybe the King himself will open his tomb to pull off my legs since I still have them!
$DIAL_H_03_01_01_012_JUDGE
I am sorry, son. I truly am.
$DIAL_H_03_01_01_013_BERNARD
I’m sorry, too. Now excuse me, I need to think of ways to waste the rest of this life of mine which you have spared with your cruel mercy.
