We made a nice profit. There was a chance of prosperity…

Why would the Renard family want to take over your shop, grandpapa?
$DIAL_H_01_01_06_003_GRANDFATHER
For profit and power. It’s always the same, and it’s no different in these times.

Today is about equality, so that not only the aristocrats can live with dignity.

Grow up, boy. I only saw the truth when they attempted to sentence my son, your uncle, to death. It suddenly dawned on me that the only things that mattered were the power I never had, and the connections I never cared for.
$DIAL_H_01_01_06_006_JUDGE
You wanted to be righteous while the injustice spread like a plague. You should not be sorry for that.
$DIAL_H_01_01_06_007_GRANDFATHER
I am not. But I would rather your brother lived so that I still had two sons.
$DIAL_H_01_01_06_008_YOUNGERSON
You have a brother, daddy? Where is he?
$DIAL_H_01_01_06_009_JUDGE
He died a long time ago, before you were born.
$DIAL_H_01_01_06_010_YOUNGERSON
Why did he die?
$DIAL_H_01_01_06_011_JUDGE
Do not talk so much while eating.
$DIAL_H_01_01_06_012_GRANDFATHER
Your uncle went to war and died in battle. Your generation will soon realise the extent of the damage we inflicted upon the world. In the past, decent people like Pochard never had to worry about courts or Tribunals, but now…
$DIAL_H_01_01_06_013_JUDGE
Do you even consider the possibility that Pochard was guilty?
$DIAL_H_01_01_06_014_YOUNGERSON
No! Not Mr Pochard!
$DIAL_H_01_01_06_015_GRANDFATHER
He was no guiltier than any of us… Son, keep an eye on the Renards.
