I promise not to take long. My case is rather obvious.
$DIAL_H_03_01_02_002_JUDGE
Of course. I am sure that nothing worse could come of this.
$DIAL_H_03_01_02_003_DESTEAL
Changes. You do not like them, especially when you know they will happen soon.
$DIAL_H_03_01_02_004_JUDGE
What kind of changes?
$DIAL_H_03_01_02_005_DESTEAL
The liberation of women of course.
$DIAL_H_03_01_02_006_JUDGE
I do not understand. Who is oppressing you?
$DIAL_H_03_01_02_007_DESTEAL
You! Men who have decided to rule over the country and take control of our fates. The Declaration of Women’s Rights clearly explains it…
$DIAL_H_03_01_02_008_JUDGE
Of course, your famous Declaration. Your legacy.
$DIAL_H_03_01_02_009_DESTEAL
I have only given a few suggestions regarding that document, as I have another duty – leading women to their ultimate success.
$DIAL_H_03_01_02_010_JUDGE
Over the corpses of men, I assume?
$DIAL_H_03_01_02_011_DESTEAL
It does not have to be so. The Declaration must be accepted in its current form. We refuse to negotiate and will not agree to any settlements. If you resist, we will protest, and you will learn what it is like to fight without our support.
$DIAL_H_03_01_02_012_JUDGE
Convincing people to accept such a great change, especially now…
$DIAL_H_03_01_02_013_DESTEAL
Since I first heard about you, you have done nothing but manipulate and scheme. I am sure you will manage. Remember that without us you will lose, but with us you may stand a chance. That is all we want – equality!
$DIAL_H_03_01_02_014_JUDGE
I believe that you overestimate women’s power, madame. I have yet to see any of you on the battlefield, although the fight is supposed to be even.
$DIAL_H_03_01_02_015_DESTEAL
What is more important is whether or not you are ready to risk our revolt. You know what we want. We shall give you a chance to think it through… Goodbye, Citizen.
