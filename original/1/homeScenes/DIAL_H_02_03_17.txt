So it was him. This whole time…
$DIAL_H_02_03_17_002_JUDGE
I am sorry, I did not know. There is no way I could have.
$DIAL_H_02_03_17_003_GRANDFATHER
Was he the one who mutilated Bernard?
$DIAL_H_02_03_17_004_JUDGE
He ordered his thugs to do it.
$DIAL_H_02_03_17_005_GRANDFATHER
I cannot believe that I raised such a monster.
$DIAL_H_02_03_17_006_JUDGE
It is not over yet – I am going to kill him. He will not stop hurting us unless I do. I must kill him.
$DIAL_H_02_03_17_007_GRANDFATHER
I lost my son long ago. Then I got him back for little more than a few seconds, only to lose him again. I am not going to defend someone who has reached the bottom for a second time. There is only darkness in his life.
$DIAL_H_02_03_17_008_JUDGE
As in mine…
$DIAL_H_02_03_17_009_GRANDFATHER
Pardon?
$DIAL_H_02_03_17_010_JUDGE
Nothing. We need to stick together.
