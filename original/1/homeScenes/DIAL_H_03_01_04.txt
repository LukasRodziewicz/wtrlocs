Father, there is something I need to say.
$DIAL_H_03_01_04_002_JUDGE
What is it?
$DIAL_H_03_01_04_003_ELDERSON
I hated you. For a long time. At one point, I thought it wasn't possible to despise someone more than I did you. But that night when your brother kidnapped us, everything changed.
$DIAL_H_03_01_04_004_JUDGE
Son...

I honestly didn't believe he would actually let us go. I looked death in the eyes, and I understood that this is just who you people are - sick, emotionally crippled.
$DIAL_H_03_01_04_006_ELDERSON
An entire generation unable to let go of the past, incapable of forgiveness. Full of anger. And we are the ones reaping what you've sown. I'm done with hatred, because I don't want to be like you.
$DIAL_H_03_01_04_007_JUDGE
I can still fix everything.
$DIAL_H_03_01_04_008_ELDERSON
You can't fix squat. Nothing will be fixed until you all die of old age and bitterness. Only then can my generation start changing the world for the better.
$DIAL_H_03_01_04_009_ELDERSON
I no longer hate you, and perhaps one day I will even manage to understand why you didn't want to be different than the rest.
$DIAL_H_03_01_04_010_JUDGE
I tried, but this is easier said than...
$DIAL_H_03_01_04_011_ELDERSON
Soon I will leave this place, and start searching for the answer to this question. You won't be able to stop me...
