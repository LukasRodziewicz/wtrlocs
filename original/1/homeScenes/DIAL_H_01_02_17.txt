You were unconscious for a long while.
$DIAL_H_01_02_17_002_JUDGE
Who is the man who - apparently - saved my life?
$DIAL_H_01_02_17_003_SPY
Grégory Ramel. You don’t know me, although I know quite a lot about you. The lady next to me is…
$DIAL_H_01_02_17_004_JUDGE
I know Grace Elliott... You were the one who sewed me up?
$DIAL_H_01_02_17_005_GRACE_ELLIOTT
It is not my first time saving someone’s life. There are more victims of the Revolution than you think.

You encroached on Minister Roland’s position, and, more importantly, on the business managed by his enterprising wife. On the establishment from which their allies – Jean-Nicolas Pache, the Mayor of Paris, and Jean-Baptiste Gobel the Archbishop of Paris – got cuts of the profits.
$DIAL_H_01_02_17_007_JUDGE
I didn’t know…
$DIAL_H_01_02_17_008_SPY
If this information was easy to learn, it means that someone is doing their job poorly.
$DIAL_H_01_02_17_009_JUDGE
But you know…
$DIAL_H_01_02_17_010_SPY
Yes, because I make my living by learning secrets. Word on the street is that the Girondins are planning to take over the Convention by force. The King’s humiliation and the revealing of the connection between the crowned traitor and Roland, a prominent Girondin, weakened them. This chance might be seized on by the Jacobins, with Robespierre and Danton at the helm. This may be their moment.
$DIAL_H_01_02_17_011_JUDGE
I want no part in this – these people are not fooling around.
$DIAL_H_01_02_17_012_SPY
I am afraid you have no say in the matter, at least as long as the Rolands are alive. As soon as they learn you survived the attack, they will try again. Your death sentence is already signed.
$DIAL_H_01_02_17_013_JUDGE
You seem to know much about me. How? I don’t understand…
$DIAL_H_01_02_17_014_GRACE_ELLIOTT
Enough for now. You have to rest, regain your strength. Your wounds…
$DIAL_H_01_02_17_015_SPY
I knew your brother…
$DIAL_H_01_02_17_016_GRACE_ELLIOTT
Monsieur Grégory!
$DIAL_H_01_02_17_017_SPY
You are right. We will speak of this another time.
$DIAL_H_01_02_17_018_JUDGE
I have yet to thank you for…
$DIAL_H_01_02_17_019_SPY
You will have another chance.
