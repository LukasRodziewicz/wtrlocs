You can berate me, as you always do.

Frédéric sometimes imagines you as a deep-sea sailor. He dreams that you visit distant countries, have wonderful adventures, and one day you’ll return and tell us all about them.

But all I see is a man in a lifeboat, and one of your oars is broken. A furious storm churns up huge waves that are fated to devour you, and I’m standing on the edge of a cliff, holding a makeshift lamp. Your children have already forgotten about you; they are far, far away. Your father died of old age. Your drinking companions now play cards with new friends…

…but not you.

Goodnight.

Before the storm creates the highest wave, you’ll have to bow before it. Alone. It will force you to become meek, and nobody will be there to see it…
