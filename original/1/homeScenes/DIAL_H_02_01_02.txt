As long as I have known you, you never were one for small talk.
$DIAL_H_02_01_02_002_RAMEL
I believe that actions speak louder than words.
$DIAL_H_02_01_02_003_JUDGE
What do our actions say about you and I?
$DIAL_H_02_01_02_004_RAMEL
That we don’t allow other people to control our lives. We are in charge of our own destiny.
$DIAL_H_02_01_02_005_JUDGE
Could you at least reveal where you are from?
$DIAL_H_02_01_02_006_RAMEL
I can tell you that, just like your brother Bruno, I have also spent some time living on the street. My older, half-brother kicked me out, and yet… I miss him.
$DIAL_H_02_01_02_007_JUDGE
I am sorry.
$DIAL_H_02_01_02_008_RAMEL
You shouldn’t be. At least now I’m strong enough to do something about it. That’s why I’m giving you Archbishop Gobel’s head on a plate.
$DIAL_H_02_01_02_009_JUDGE
Why?
$DIAL_H_02_01_02_010_RAMEL
Because he was the one who planned your son’s death, and I learned of his deepest secret.
$DIAL_H_02_01_02_011_JUDGE
Why did Gobel attack me?
$DIAL_H_02_01_02_012_RAMEL
You dealt with the Rolands and almost did the same to Pache.
$DIAL_H_02_01_02_013_RAMEL
They were linked, so he must have thought that he would be your next target and decided to send you a message.
$DIAL_H_02_01_02_014_JUDGE
Now I will send him one of my own.
$DIAL_H_02_01_02_015_RAMEL
Kill everyone who has raised a hand to your family, it's the most precious thing you have. This is your best opportunity to attack as people are blaming the clergy for stirring the rebellion in the Vendée.
