Everything pointed to Gobel.
$DIAL_H_02_01_06_002_JUDGE
If it was really Renard who was responsible for my son’s death, then I should not have started a war with Gobel.
$DIAL_H_02_01_06_003_RAMEL
I made a mistake. I’m sorry.
$DIAL_H_02_01_06_004_JUDGE
There is Gobel on one side and furious, revenge-driven aristocrats on the other. A war on two fronts at once, at a time when our country itself is consumed by civil war.
$DIAL_H_02_01_06_005_RAMEL
Maybe you should agree to that alliance?
$DIAL_H_02_01_06_006_JUDGE
I will not ally with the murderers of my child!
$DIAL_H_02_01_06_007_RAMEL
You still have another one.
$DIAL_H_02_01_06_008_JUDGE
I will not do it.
$DIAL_H_02_01_06_009_RAMEL
It’s your life. But I would prefer not to bury any more of your family.
