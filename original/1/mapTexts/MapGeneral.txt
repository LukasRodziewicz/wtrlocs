$MAP_NEWSPAPER_A1_05
People may have discussed this for several days already, but always in whispers and with doubts. Today, we can shout it at the top of our lungs – Jean-Marie Roland destroyed evidence of Louis’s treason, evidence that was stored in Capet’s iron cabinet. The troubling report has been confirmed by Phillipe Côté, who was with the minister when he opened the cabinet. Roland also tried to destroy the documents that incriminated him. Fortunately, he did not succeed in damaging them all. He was stopped by guards that were sent by the rightfully cautious Robespierre. Shame!
$MAP_NEWSPAPER_A1_03
“The hero of Paris revealed! Judge Alexis Fidèle sentenced and supervised the execution of traitor Louis Capet, the former King. He did so without hesitation, and without mercy. Paris has a new defender!”
$MAP_NEWSPAPER_A1_04
“Prussians at the gates of France! Central command has decided to begin fresh recruitment to repel the approaching enemy. Everyone with a brave heart and a love for the Republic shall fight alongside their brothers and die for…”
$MAP_NEWSPAPER_A1_06
Enemy at the gates! That is not a distant and unrealistic future. It will be imminent if we do not purify our society. Stay alert and look for enemies of the Republic – agents of the Ancien Régime may still be among you! Killing the traitor Capet should not cause us to relax our vigilance!
$MAP_NEWSPAPER_A2_FIRST_01
The Rolands were the first victims of that stinking judge. Fidèle had them wrapped around his finger, and now they are six feet under.
$MAP_NEWSPAPER_A2_FIRST_02
He was clearly not satisfied with two victims, as quite a number of Girondins have also been sent to the guillotine. Allegedly for treason, but who can know for sure?
$MAP_NEWSPAPER_A2_FIRST_03
It is a little-known fact that he was one of those responsible for the massacre on the protesters after Capet’s escape. He signed his permission to shoot at those people!
$MAP_NEWSPAPER_A2_FIRST_04
Earlier, he as good as sentenced Commander-in-Chief Burel to death by not helping him to calm the furious crowd.
$MAP_NEWSPAPER_A2_FIRST_05
After the scandal with Minister Roland and his wife, the Tribunal seized their fortune, including the brothel managed by Madame Roland. And who was it who dealt with this? Officially, Commander-in-Chief Hanriot, though Fidèle was said to have claimed his share of the profits.
$MAP_NEWSPAPER_A2_SECOND_01
The Mayor of Paris shared a similar fate. Fidèle led to his fall, believing that Pache was responsible for the assassination attempt on him.
$MAP_NEWSPAPER_A2_SECOND_02
In order to get to Pache, he set the Muscadins on Paris. Once they learned about the Mayor’s wrongdoings, they began vandalising the city. With Fidèle’s permission!
$MAP_NEWSPAPER_A2_SECOND_03
He objected to completing the construction of the bridge [if that's what the player chose] He was strongly against finalising the construction of the bridge. I understand that his son was hung there, but his personal feelings should not affect the whole city.
$MAP_NEWSPAPER_A2_SECOND_04
Béatrice Caron is another victim of “the Beast of the Tribunal”. That poor girl has been framed for a plot against Pache and treason. Her life was destroyed overnight.
$MAP_NEWSPAPER_A2_SECOND_05
This led to her death. The poorly constructed plot made Pache’s daughter, Marie, kill Béatrice. The two women were having an affair.
$MAP_NEWSPAPER_A2_SECOND_06
He also led to the death of Marie Sylvie Pache “The Beast of the Tribunal” has finally silenced the last witness of those events by sentencing Marie Sylvie Pache to death. He has now disposed of everyone who could disgrace him.
$MAP_NEWSPAPER_A2_THIRD_01
Next, “the Beast of the Tribunal” began to spread the disgusting rumours about Gobel’s illegitimate child. Who could have known what terrible consequences that would bring? Alexis Fidèle knew perfectly well.
$MAP_NEWSPAPER_A2_THIRD_02
I am sure that the judge used the unrest at Vendée to incense the capital city and make the common folk, who had already turned their backs on the clergy, oppose Gobel as well.
$MAP_NEWSPAPER_A2_THIRD_03
He attacked Gobel’s initiative. Wanting to help the exhausted society, the archbishop began to help the poor. Fidèle immediately stopped that initiative. His political goal was more important to him than the well-being of the people!
$MAP_NEWSPAPER_A2_THIRD_04
But the most hideous crime “the Beast of the Tribunal” committed was yet to come. Fidèle kidnapped Gobel’s family to blackmail him. It could even be said that by doing so his actions led to the horrifying result of the son killing his own father!
$MAP_NEWSPAPER_A2_FOURTH_01
Alexis Fidèle is known for his drunkenness and gambling. It is clear that uncontrollable behaviour is deeply rooted in this family.
$MAP_NEWSPAPER_A2_FOURTH_02
The judge’s brother was banished from the city for mutilating a young boy. He almost battered him to death with a wooden club. The victim is still unable to complete the simple tasks of daily life without assistance.
$MAP_NEWSPAPER_A2_FOURTH_03
As far as I know, the judge has continued to maintain ambiguous contact with Grace Elliot – a prostitute who spied for the English.
$MAP_NEWSPAPER_A2_FOURTH_04
His wife was no better than her husband. Mathilde Fidèle was not faithful in her marriage, as she was allegedly seen by some with Commander-in-Chief Hanriot – the same man whose candidacy was supported by Alexis Fidèle, and who turned out to be Robespierre’s dog.
$MAP_NEWSPAPER_A2_FOURTH_05
Fidèle’s relation with a certain Grégory Ramel is also unclear. Ramel allegedly obtained information for “the Beast of the Tribunal”, and Fidèle was apparently not bothered that his associate used to spy for the English.
