Now THAT is overstepping! You went too far, Citizens! This “misunderstanding” will cost you your heads!
$MAP_PATROL_002_JUDGE_MANI
You have the wrong man. Thank goodness you did not hurt him… The consequences would be dire. Such a misunderstanding…
$MAP_PATROL_003_JUDGE_JOKE
Thank goodness it was you, not some other lads itching to advance through the ranks of the Guard. We are going to solve this misunderstanding post-haste.
$MAP_PATROL_004_JUDGE_HUMI
My good Citizens, we will have to let this man go free. A terrible misunderstanding has occurred – even the Revolution is not always infallible.
$MAP_PATROL_005_PATROL_INTR
And why’s that?
$MAP_PATROL_006_PATROL_DOUB
What a lark. I must be going deaf. Arresting a spy is now a “misunderstanding”?
$MAP_PATROL_007_PATROL_IRRI
Sweeping this whole venture under the rug, are we, monsieur le juge?
$MAP_PATROL_008_JUDGE_AGGR
You have captured an associate of the Revolutionary Tribunal!
$MAP_PATROL_009_JUDGE_MANI
You have caught a covert Agent of the Revolutionary Tribunal.
$MAP_PATROL_010_JUDGE_JOKE
Absurd! Your prisoner actually works for me.
$MAP_PATROL_011_JUDGE_HUMI
It is one of my assistants. Forgive me, gentlemen, that I did not inform you earlier.
$MAP_PATROL_016_JUDGE_AGGR
Your actions reek of treason! Think twice before you decide to stand against me.
$MAP_PATROL_017_JUDGE_MANI
You are harming the Revolution and you’re harming yourselves! I can have you arrested for treason.
$MAP_PATROL_018_JUDGE_JOKE
These days, it is not that hard to lose one’s head because of treason. And holding my agent can surely help you with that.
$MAP_PATROL_019_JUDGE_HUMI
If you do not release him, I will have to charge you with treason. Do not take it personally, but I have to protect the Republic.
$MAP_PATROL_020_JUDGE_AGGR
Busy yourselves with seeking out real traitors… and be extremely careful not to pester any more of my agents. If you fail to do so, we will have to go over our little talk again!
$MAP_PATROL_021_JUDGE_MANI
We have real traitors out there. Root them out, and do not be discouraged by failures such as this. Although in your next endeavours, do try to avoid persecuting my agents.
$MAP_PATROL_022_JUDGE_JOKE
Anyone can make a mistake. It is fine. Maybe next time you will have more luck with your investigation?
$MAP_PATROL_023_JUDGE_HUMI
You do important work for the Republic. This mistake does not change that. You have my support in your ventures and you would do well to remember that.
$MAP_PATROL_024_PATROL_SATI
And to think we almost lynched our brother! It’s good that you came along, we’d already sharpened a pike for his head. We’re glad to have you on our side. Go in good health!
$MAP_PATROL_025_PATROL_INTR
Maybe he's one of yours, I dunno, but evidently he got lost while in town. We just found him and we'll gladly let him go, though we would appreciate some kind of… finder's fee.
$MAP_PATROL_026_PATROL_DOUB
I get the impression you aren’t telling us the whole story. I dunno what business you two have going on, but it all seems suspicious. You don’t convince me.
$MAP_PATROL_027_PATROL_IRRI
You don’t think we’re idiots, do you? Why are you feeding us this nonsense then?! Just you wait, we’ll find out who this fellow is and accuse you of treason!
$MAP_PATROL_BRIBE_00
I hope this pouch can calm your Revolutionary zeal.
$MAP_PATROL_BRIBE_01
We’ll see about that. Now scram and take your buddy with you.
$MAP_PATROL_TOPIC_01
Arresting this man was simply a misunderstanding.
$MAP_PATROL_TOPIC_02
The man you arrested is working for me.
$MAP_PATROL_TOPIC_04
Imprisoning him is a crime against the Revolution!
$MAP_PATROL_TOPIC_05
You should look for real criminals.
$MAP_PATROL_RESULT_SUCCESS
