Cleaner Conscience
$EVE_001_MAIN_01
René is eight years old, Augusta is four – the victims of an unknown power. And there are many more, most at an age that does not allow them to earn a living. Their only alternative is to beg on the streets, but many of these broken souls rot in dark alleys. Some of them have lost their parents to the guillotine after you yourself decided their fates. The orphanage’s warden is constantly looking for donors to help keep the minor victims of justice under the roof of the institution. An easy way to clear one’s conscience.

The warden would like to thank you. The children too. Some of them.

Most of the orphans listened to you with true interest. Not all of them succumbed to your charm. Two began sobbing – you sentenced their father to death for the distribution of Royalist pamphlets. Do you not remember? Another girl ran out of the room in the middle of your story. You had something to do with her mother being sent to the guillotine. Then again, the others listened. Most of them would love to become judges like you.
