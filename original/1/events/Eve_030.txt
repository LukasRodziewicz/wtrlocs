Frenchmen marched in the streets of Paris side by side, one line after another, to commemorate Jacques Guillaume Simoneau, Mayor of Étampes. He was murdered by a furious mob, punished for a law he did not enact but was obliged to observe. Freedom of speech killed him – if we understand this as the right to cast stones to show one’s discontent, the right to murder people because you deem them responsible for your miserable life. Surely the people of Paris would prefer if we said that nothing happened…

Will such solemn demonstrations change anything? Next time a desperate soul decides to stone a public officer for observing the law, will they remember their presence at this march? Will a starving man feed himself on the memories of Jacques Guillaume Simoneau, Mayor of Étampes? I would rather not to be nearby to witness that.
