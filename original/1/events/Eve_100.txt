Citizen Capet’s Imprisonment
$EVE_100_MAIN_01
Citizen Capet worked hard to find his way to the guillotine. But even if he had not, you should have decapitated him so the people of France could draw a definitive line between the dark past and the new France. You decided differently, and now the former King shall rot in prison, reliving the pain of those who used to be imprisoned in the Bastille. Should some madman free him, nobody will be able to recognise the proud Capet, so miserable and emaciated he will have become. The world will reorganise and Louis will become obsolete.
