Your addictions are no longer a secret. The fact that other children are bullying your son because of them is a minor problem. But who is spreading those rumours? It is likely to be one of their parents. They could have whispered into their children’s ears whom they shouldn’t play with and why. They might even have spiced the story up with a lie. But who will hear it next?

Most Parisians are… ordinary. They have ordinary problems, ordinary consciences, and an ordinary resistance to pain. They were not hardened by the Revolution. The father of the family that spread the rumour about your weaknesses was no different. A few punches were more than enough to convince his instincts that it was time to stop talking.

The exchange of pleasantries did not take long. Most people stop being brave the moment they face danger. This time, the dangers could be described as “the Judge of the Revolutionary Tribunal” and “a one-metre long bludgeon in the hand of a Guard”. Once the last words had left your mouth, the man’s gaze dropped to the ground. He did not even look at the weapon held by the Guard, who was eager to hear just one word of objection. That should deal with the problem.

The father had a rare episode of foolishness when he decided to stand up to someone stronger, threatening him with a fist and showing his children they are safe by his side. He did not listen to your arguments. Furthermore, he gave a precise description of where you can shove them.
