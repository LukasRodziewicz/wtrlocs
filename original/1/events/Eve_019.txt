Is That Yours…?
$EVE_019_MAIN_01
Decapitation still had not lost its charm since the beginning of the Revolution. A group of people were gathered in a Parisian street surrounding something on the floor. Your prestigious position allowed you to make your way to the centre of the mob, only to find a man’s severed head. What had caught everyone’s attention was the head’s facial expression – it was grinning. It was so unusual that the crowd stared, hypnotised, for no apparent reason. You wonder if anyone had thought to ask about the rest of the corpse. A lone severed head should definitely cause curiosity, even if for purely scientific reasons. And now you are staring alongside everybody else.

The smiling head was removed and the people dispersed. That’s Paris.

I don’t know how long they continued staring at the head, or how long it was smiling.
