Revolutionary Holiday
$EVE_036_MAIN_01
Recent days have proven that Paris can win. That France can win. We managed to overcome our past, divesting our last remaining tyrant of his power. Now it is time to rebuild. To create symbols that inspire future generations. That is why during a gathering of the Convention several enterprising Citizens proposed the construction of a statue to commemorate the Revolutionary victory over injustice. You were given the honour of supervising the construction – there is no better candidate than the one who vanquished Louis Capet. You have an opportunity to leave yet another mark on Paris.
