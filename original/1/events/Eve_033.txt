Marat’s Revolutions
$EVE_033_MAIN_01
Marat was nothing but thorough. This morning, parisians were greeted by a special issue of his newspaper, in which he summed up your actions since taking office. He wrote about your elimination of the Rolands, how you exterminated the girondins on Robespierre’s command. He talked at length about how you destroyed the lives of the mayor and his daughter. The Muscadins will learn that you framed Béatrice for espionage… Each of your sins, minor and major alike, was described with nigh-annalistic solicitude of someone who had been watching your every move for a while now. Your brother wasn’t kidding - this is far from over...

Even from beyond the grave, Marat can deal substantial damage. The night before his death he was able to typeset the last issue of his paper, focusing on your most recent misdeeds. He claimed that you were the one behind Gobel’s death - you, the true mastermind, not Gobel’s son. The paper also described how you overthrew Robespierre only to gain absolute power in France. There is no need to tell you what else was written. You know the truth. You know that his words contain more truth than lies. Everyone feels the same, even if they are not sure. And your family knows what you are capable of… In the eyes of Paris, you are a monster who was exposed by Marat. A monster who killed and buried the Revolution.
