Jean-Nicolas Pache
$INTRIGUE_002_DESC
The assassins who tried to take your life must have been paid by someone, and everything points to the Mayor of Paris. He is too cautious to let you attack him. You must catch him off guard.

Let Hanriot Manage the Brothel
$INTR_002_B01_DESC
Pache likes to gamble and flaunt his money. We should expand the brothel’s activities to include games of cards and dice – I know how much you like the latter. Commander Hanriot will be responsible for security. Pache must feel safe with us.
$INTR_002_B02_TITLE
Let David Manage the Brothel
$INTR_002_B02_DESC
If you want to lure Pache, you must do so with class. The brothel taken from Roland would be the perfect trap, but we still have to make it even more luxurious by adding gambling to the range of attractions it offers. Dice, for example. As an artist, David will surely add a certain extravagance that will tempt even an idler like Pache, and he will not expect it.
$INTR_002_B03_TITLE
Meeting with the Mayor
$INTR_002_B03_DESC
We must meet him face to face in order to make him believe that we do not know about his involvement in the attempt on your life.
$INTR_002_B04_TITLE
Following Marie Sylvie Pache
$INTR_002_B04_DESC
Before we act, David must confirm the nature of the relationship the Mayor’s daughter has with Béatrice Caron. If they are having an affair, Pache will be furious, and you will help him to make that one mistake we need so much…
$INTR_002_B05_TITLE
Meeting in the Gambling Den
$INTR_002_B05_DESC
It is time for Pache to get a taste of victory and good tobacco, all in the newly created gambling den. It is time he felt… safe.
$INTR_002_B06_TITLE
Arresting Béatrice Caron
$INTR_002_B06_DESC
Hanriot’s guards will waylay the Mayor’s daughter and her lover at their usual rendezvous. Béatrice will be arrested, and wait for what happens next in isolation. We will no longer have any use for Marie.
$INTR_002_B07_TITLE
Béatrice, traitor
$INTR_002_B07_DESC
We must “convince” her to sign a document stating that she is an Austrian spy, that Jean-Nicolas Pache was her source, and that she reached him through his daughter.
$INTR_002_B08_TITLE
Meeting with Danton
$INTR_002_B08_DESC
Even with the document signed by Béatrice, we still do not have a complete hold on the Mayor. He could still ask his silver-tongued friend Danton for help. Pache needs to be entirely alone. If we do not convince Danton to take our side, we will lose.

Arresting the Mayor
$INTR_002_B09_DESC
There is no better time to make a political arrest than in the middle of the night. You must strike now!
$INTR_002_B10_TITLE
Béatrice Caron – Blackmailer
$INTR_002_B10_DESC
Béatrice was able to escape the guards and send a message to Marie Pache. She told her to be at rue Saint-Maur with the money to compensate for the damage done by their relationship. We must intervene. Béatrice turned out to be unreasonable – instead of saving her life and running to the other side of Europe, she remained in Paris to engage in blackmail. She is extorting money from a person she was supposed to love. The entire plan will collapse if she talks about the testimony we made her sign.

Go with the guards
$INTR_002_B10_DECISION_1
Send the guards alone
$INTR_002_SLOT_01_DESC
Decide who will manage the seized brothel.
$INTR_002_BLOCK_004_PATH_STR
Send your guard to take care of it – we do not have to hide.
$INTR_002_BLOCK_004_PATH_DIP
David’s presence should not raise any suspicions.
$INTR_002_BLOCK_004_PATH_ESP
Let Ramel handle it. He knows every dark alley of this city.
$INTR_002_BLOCK_004_PATH_STR_FAILURE
Clovis is clumsy and… too big to act discreetly. He obtained the information, but the Muscadins noticed him.
$INTR_002_BLOCK_004_PATH_DIP_FAILURE
The Muscadins turned out to be paranoid. Even the presence of the gregarious David raised their suspicions. You learned everything you wanted to, but at the price of their anger.
$INTR_002_BLOCK_004_PATH_ESP_FAILURE
Ramel is good, but his presence was revealed by a drunken Muscadin who recognised an old friend as he tried to leave. Your spy was able to flee through a back alley, but from now on the Muscadins will be more cautious…
$INTR_002_BLOCK_006_PATH_STR
Hanriot will make a show! Let every neighbour know that we want to arrest the traitor.
$INTR_002_BLOCK_006_PATH_DIP
Hanriot will arrest her before she leaves to see Marie, politely and respecting her rights.
$INTR_002_BLOCK_006_PATH_ESP
Tell Hanriot to arrest her in an alley on her way to meet Marie. Quietly, discreetly.
$INTR_002_BLOCK_006_PATH_STR_FAILURE
The Muscadins decided to defend one of their girls. Shots were fired. We have Caron, but there were casualties on both sides…
$INTR_002_BLOCK_006_PATH_DIP_FAILURE
Béatrice did not appreciate our efforts. She cried that she was being assaulted and raped, and was soon aided by people throwing stones. The guards were forced to use violence…
$INTR_002_BLOCK_006_PATH_ESP_FAILURE
The Muscadins have become more cautious and are trying not to walk alone. The guards were forced to crush the bones of several of the girl’s companions…
$INTR_002_B10_EVENT_TITLE
FREEDOM!
$INTR_002_B10_EVENT_TEXT
Marie killed. Twice. The guards found Béatrice’s body, stabbed by the Mayor’s daughter. When Marie noticed the guards, she allegedly cried “Freedom!” and cut her own throat. The situation got out of hand. Information travels quickly, and the Mayor is likely to already know what happened to his daughter, that she paid for his sins. Do not feel guilty. Focus on tomorrow’s trials. Do not feel guilty…
