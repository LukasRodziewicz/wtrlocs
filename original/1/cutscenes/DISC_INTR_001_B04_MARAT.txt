Thank you for coming.

The things we do for the Judges of the Tribunal…
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_MARAT_003_JUDGE
I would like to talk about Minister Roland.
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_MARAT_004_MARAT
I see…
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_MARAT_005_JUDGE_AGGR
Roland is a rotten louse. Corruption cannot become the hallmark of the new authorities.
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_MARAT_006_JUDGE_MANI
Does Roland really represent the people? Or is he instead working to the benefit of Capet and his servants?
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_MARAT_007_JUDGE_JOKE
We need to get rid of Roland for his own good. His pockets will soon burst apart from the amount of money he keeps in them.
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_MARAT_008_JUDGE_HUMI
France is bleeding and people like Roland will not let it heal its wounds. On the contrary, they only make them deeper.
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_MARAT_009_MARAT_INTR
I understand your motives. Personally, I also hate people like Roland.
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_MARAT_010_MARAT_DOUB
You stepped on his toes and he made his own move in return. How does that benefit the state?
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_MARAT_011_JUDGE_AGGR
Roland is not only guilty of bribes. He threatened a Judge of the Revolutionary Tribunal. The independent judiciary!
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_MARAT_012_JUDGE_MANI
In order to avoid punishment, Roland started a vendetta against me. By doing so, did he not declare war on the new order?
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_MARAT_013_JUDGE_JOKE
Mr and Mrs Roland are two mosquitoes, biting me, draining the blood of France. Nobody likes mosquitoes.
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_MARAT_014_JUDGE_HUMI
My own antipathy towards the minister does not change the fact that we should replace this corrupt Royalist with someone more just.
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_MARAT_015_JUDGE_AGGR
If you do not persuade the deputies, it will be proof that you tolerate the traitors who are still exercising their influence throughout France!
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_MARAT_016_JUDGE_MANI
Let your readers know you are not just a heckler who desires to be praised. Show them that you care for France.
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_MARAT_017_JUDGE_JOKE
The Girondins often trip over their own feet. You need only give them a gentle push.
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_MARAT_018_JUDGE_HUMI
There are times when Roland is closer to the Ancien Régime than Louis. If you want to be rid of the old order, now is your chance.
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_MARAT_019_MARAT_SATI
I have finally met someone who wants to be rid of those bloody Girondins. Long live Judge Fidèle!
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_MARAT_020_MARAT_INTR
The quick fall of Minister Roland and his clever wife will make the Girondins feel the consequences. You can count on my help.
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_MARAT_021_MARAT_DOUB
Your war with Roland is not my concern. I have nothing to gain from cooperating with an ordinary judge.

What do we want to achieve?
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_MARAT_TOPIC_02
Why do we want it?
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_MARAT_TOPIC_03
What will he get out of it?
