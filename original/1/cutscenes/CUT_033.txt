Mathilde.
$CUT_033_002_JUDGE
I do not understand.
$CUT_033_003_JUDGE
Father.
$CUT_033_004_JUDGE
Do you hear me?
$CUT_033_005_GOD
Always.
$CUT_033_006_GOD
I fixed you. You will live… at least for now.
$CUT_033_007_JUDGE
Where am I? Who are you?
$CUT_033_008_GOD
I am the Truth about your unhappiness and the Lie about your greatness. They are both the reasons for your presence in this place.
$CUT_033_009_GOD
Where everything started.
$CUT_033_010_JUDGE
I don’t understand.
$CUT_033_011_GOD
I repaired all the damage, as I always do. You will live… but do you want to?
$CUT_033_012_GOD
Are you ready to admit that it is my performance, my show?
$CUT_033_013_JUDGE
Mathilde. I love her so…
$CUT_033_014_GOD
I know… but she no longer returns that love. Not for a long time.
$CUT_033_015_GOD
I made sure of that.
$CUT_033_016_JUDGE
Who the hell are you?
$CUT_033_017_GOD
I am the Truth overcoming the Lie that you keep telling yourself. The Lie that you are here for power.
$CUT_033_018_GOD
For the numerous choices and endings. I have not designed you for that.
$CUT_033_019_JUDGE
Designed?
$CUT_033_020_GOD
You are supposed to suffer to make others laugh or grieve.
$CUT_033_021_GOD
To feel.
$CUT_033_022_GOD
Now is the only real choice you will ever make.
$CUT_033_023_GOD
To die, and never feel anything again, or to really feel what being a true hero is like.
$CUT_033_024_JUDGE
I am a judge, not a–
$CUT_033_025_GOD
Tell me, when was the last time you read all the files connected to a single case?
$CUT_033_026_GOD
The last time you really heard everything the accused had to say?
$CUT_033_027_GOD
I need a hero, not a judge. People want to be heroes.
$CUT_033_028_JUDGE
How could I? My wife wanted to kill me. My family hates me.
$CUT_033_029_GOD
Fight for their lives.
$CUT_033_030_JUDGE
Half the city wants me dead.
$CUT_033_031_GOD
Fight for Paris.
$CUT_033_032_JUDGE
My brother comes with an unconquerable army.
$CUT_033_033_GOD
Then be a shield for the poor and terrified souls who do not have anyone else to defend them.
$CUT_033_034_JUDGE
A shield…
$CUT_033_035_GOD
I could open your wounds instead
$CUT_033_036_GOD
and you will never suffer again.
$CUT_033_037_GOD
Paris would fall, but since you are not interested, I would find someone in your place.
$CUT_033_038_GOD
Here is the choice you craved so dearly for.
$CUT_033_DEATH_DEC
Choose Death
$CUT_033_DEATH_DEC_001_GOD
Ah, what a pity.
$CUT_033_DEATH_DEC_002_GOD
After all my hard work…
$CUT_033_DEATH_DEC_003_GOD
You have, however, made a decision.
$CUT_033_LIFE_DEC
Choose Life
$CUT_033_LIFE_DEC_001_JUDGE
Will they accept me?
$CUT_033_LIFE_DEC_002_GOD
They do not have to, but you will defend them anyway.
$CUT_033_LIFE_DEC_003_GOD
You will become a legend for it, and one day, they will appreciate you.
$CUT_033_LIFE_DEC_004_GOD
Now rise up. You have to defeat him.
