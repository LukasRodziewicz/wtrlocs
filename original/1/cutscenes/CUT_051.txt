“Terror is nothing but swift justice.”
$CUT_051_DUMAS_002
Robespierre used to say that.
$CUT_051_DUMAS_003
And now an army of outcasts marches towards us to present their interpretation of those words.
$CUT_051_JUDGE_004
Do you come to arrest me?
$CUT_051_DUMAS_005
I came to tell you that certain people believe everything you did, you did for the benefit of France.
$CUT_051_JUDGE_006
Who are you?
$CUT_051_DUMAS_007
Officer Thomas-Alexandre Dumas, from the French army, at your service.
$CUT_051_JUDGE_008
Do you believe in what those few say about me?
$CUT_051_DUMAS_009
Most deputies of the Convention fled once they learned of the approaching army.
$CUT_051_DUMAS_010
The reinforcements that would be able to save us will take a dozen or so days to reach Paris.
$CUT_051_JUDGE_011
Do you believe that I did everything because of France?
$CUT_051_DUMAS_012
No. But as far as I heard, you know the enemy better than anyone of us.
$CUT_051_DUMAS_013
As a commander, I certainly appreciate that asset. And as a human being, 
I know that brotherhood is especially important when someone is falling.
$CUT_051_DUMAS_014
You reached the bottom, but there are people willing to give you a chance to redeem yourself.
$CUT_051_JUDGE_015
I think you are talking to the wrong person…
$CUT_051_DUMAS_016
I am talking to a predator!
$CUT_051_DUMAS_017
I am talking to a person who is not averse to killing other Citizens.
$CUT_051_DUMAS_018
And that is what awaits us. We will have to ruthlessly murder Frenchmen who stand on the other side of the barricades.
$CUT_051_DUMAS_019
I am talking to a murderer, because that is how you are known to those who are afraid of you.
$CUT_051_DUMAS_020
As ghastly as it sounds – you are exactly who we need.
$CUT_051_JUDGE_021
You said yourself that reinforcements are a dozen or more days away…
$CUT_051_DUMAS_022
That is why I gathered an army of loyal people.
$CUT_051_DUMAS_023
I will entrust them to you under one condition.
$CUT_051_JUDGE_024
Did you say, “an army”?
$CUT_051_DUMAS_025
Look for yourself.
$CUT_051_DUMAS_026
A truly revolutionary army.
$CUT_051_DUMAS_027
The poor and the wealthy, white and black people, all marching side by side.
$CUT_051_DUMAS_028
They came here to protect Paris.
$CUT_051_JUDGE_029
You mentioned one condition.
$CUT_051_DUMAS_030
Make me a general.
$CUT_051_DUMAS_031
The first black commander of that high a rank in the whole of France.
$CUT_051_DUMAS_032
So that you and I can be equals, like brothers.
$CUT_051_JUDGE_033
I do not have such power.
$CUT_051_DUMAS_034
But you do. You still hold the power of the guillotine, remember?
$CUT_051_DUMAS_035
Support me and the army will be yours.
$CUT_051_DUMAS_036
Regardless of their origin or race,
$CUT_051_DUMAS_037
those people believe that if they are scared of you, our enemy should be even more terrified.
$CUT_051_JUDGE_038
Hand me a piece of paper and a pen, general.
