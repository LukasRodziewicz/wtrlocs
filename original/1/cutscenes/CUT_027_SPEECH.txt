When the Committee was taken by Robespierre, it stopped serving its purpose. Only the heavy hand of justice can restore order there!
$CUT_027_SPEECH_002_JUDGE_MANI
The Committee became entangled in bribery and treason. Who else can cut the Gordian knot, if not the guardian of the law?
$CUT_027_SPEECH_003_JUDGE_JOKE
The Committee is filled with old and slow politicians. Let’s bring some fresh, bold blood into them!
$CUT_027_SPEECH_004_JUDGE_HUMI
Within the Committee you can find the greatest among us, but even they can err. They need a new, young captain.
$CUT_027_SPEECH_005_JUDGE_AGGR
All the criminals and traitors within the Committee will tremble out of fear for prosecutor Tinville! Nothing can be hidden from us.
$CUT_027_SPEECH_006_JUDGE_MANI
Tinville has proven many times that nothing can stop him from finding the wrongdoings of the fallen.
$CUT_027_SPEECH_007_JUDGE_JOKE
Nobody but prosecutor Tinville was brave enough to do that.
$CUT_027_SPEECH_008_JUDGE_HUMI
We are incredibly lucky that our hero showed up. Prosecutor Tinville agreed to bring back order in the Committee.
$CUT_027_SPEECH_009_JUDGE_AGGR
If you, too, have had enough of the Convention’s constant explanations about the difficulty of the situation, let’s simplify thing for them with a show of hands for prosecutor Tinville!
$CUT_027_SPEECH_010_JUDGE_MANI
Danton decided to sacrifice himself and make room for Tinville. Are you going to support him too?
$CUT_027_SPEECH_011_JUDGE_JOKE
The situation cannot get any worse anyway. Maybe Tinville will be our saviour?
$CUT_027_SPEECH_012_JUDGE_HUMI
France has suffered too much already. Its Citizens have suffered too much. Will you support Tinville, our spark of hope?
$CUT_027_SPEECH_013_JUDGE
Do you want to keep being hungry? Do you wish to continue witnessing the bribery among those who rule us?
$CUT_027_SPEECH_014_CROWD
No!
$CUT_027_SPEECH_015_CROWD
We must get to Robespierre!
$CUT_027_SPEECH_016_JUDGE
Tinville will save us!
$CUT_027_SPEECH_017_CROWD
Tinville!
$CUT_027_SPEECH_018_CROWD
We want bread!

It is high time I pay attention to that judge of yours…
$CUT_027_SPEECH_TOPIC_01
Now is the time to restore order to the Committee of Public Safety.
$CUT_027_SPEECH_TOPIC_02
Tinville agreed to take on this difficult task.
$CUT_027_SPEECH_TOPIC_03
Will he have your support?
