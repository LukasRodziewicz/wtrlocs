Do you have any idea how that sounds? Aristocrats plotting with Robespierre? Restoration of the monarchy?
$CUT_047_DISC_HANRIOT_002_JUDGE
Do not forget about my child. They told me to my face that they had a hand in his death. They are not afraid of anything.
$CUT_047_DISC_HANRIOT_003_HANRIOT
First you became involved in the conflict with Hébert and Danton against Robespierre, and now you want to start a fight with Renard! I do not like this at all.
$CUT_047_DISC_HANRIOT_004_JUDGE
Do you think you will keep your position… what am I saying… that you will keep your head once they return? Once the monarchy is restored? Renard must die, and so must Robespierre for his unfortunate choice of friends.
$CUT_047_DISC_HANRIOT_005_HANRIOT
So you say, but I know nothing of his choice of friends.
$CUT_047_DISC_HANRIOT_006_JUDGE_AGGR
Are you deaf? Would I drag you here if I were not sure? Renard suggested as much while standing right in front of me.
$CUT_047_DISC_HANRIOT_007_JUDGE_MANI
My information has always been correct. Renard looked me in the eyes when he told me about the plot. All I saw was a predator that had smelled blood.
$CUT_047_DISC_HANRIOT_008_JUDGE_JOKE
Do you not trust me? Me? Would you doubt an older brother who warned you not to touch a hot stove? Why would I mislead you?
$CUT_047_DISC_HANRIOT_009_JUDGE_HUMI
I know that you are well informed, but this is not something you could have learned alone. You could not have, fortunately, because you are not a pawn in the plans of Renard and Robespierre.
$CUT_047_DISC_HANRIOT_010_JUDGE_AGGR
Are you hesitating? Know that Renard has long tried to take control of Paris. He wanted to utilise the chaos, and even increase it should the need arise. By killing someone’s child, for example!
$CUT_047_DISC_HANRIOT_011_JUDGE_MANI
Renard crossed the line when he attacked my family. And he will do it again. Are you ready to gamble when the lives of your loved ones are at stake?
$CUT_047_DISC_HANRIOT_012_JUDGE_JOKE
Of course, we can let the crazy Royalist do as he pleases. We can pretend that the despot is unable to be corrupted. Why not cut our own heads off before they make the official announcement?
$CUT_047_DISC_HANRIOT_013_JUDGE_HUMI
Nothing will bring my child back, but there are still others that can be saved. But to ensure that, we must oppose tyranny and corruption. Now is our chance.
$CUT_047_DISC_HANRIOT_014_HANRIOT_DOUB
A forgotten aristocrat would be such a monster? Are you suggesting that Robespierre approves of the actions of Renard? That he would have children murdered in the streets?
$CUT_047_DISC_HANRIOT_015_HANRIOT_IRRI
As a judge of the Tribunal, you should know that there is no crime without proof. Do you have any? If not, you ought to cease your slander of a French citizen immediately.
$CUT_047_DISC_HANRIOT_016_HANRIOT_AGGR
Oh, stop your crazy ranting, Fidèle! Plots, murders… Do you think I am a child? Do you think an aristocrat would be responsible for all of that? Maybe he is also hiding a new King in his pocket!
$CUT_047_DISC_HANRIOT_017_JUDGE_AGGR
Clearly you need some motivation, so I will gladly provide it. Once we remove them, there will be empty spaces in the upper ranks. We will fill them with or without you, but we would rather have you by our side. Consider that your thirty pieces of silver!
$CUT_047_DISC_HANRIOT_018_JUDGE_MANI
You must look further ahead. When those two scoundrels disappear, not only will we stop the plot, but we will also create a void that will have to be filled. By us. By you and I.
$CUT_047_DISC_HANRIOT_019_JUDGE_JOKE
If you are still worrying that you will not benefit from allying with us, rest assured that, once those two idlers disappear, we will immediately arrange for you to take a high position. And keep it for as long as you please. New authorities, my friend.
$CUT_047_DISC_HANRIOT_020_JUDGE_HUMI
Renard and Robespierre cannot continue their wrongdoings! I know that deep in your heart you are also furious. We cannot let them gain complete control… if only because we, the defenders of Paris, deserve it far more than them.
$CUT_047_DISC_HANRIOT_021_JUDGE_AGGR
Do you see these hands, Hanriot? These hands hold your position in their grasp, but your stubbornness and indecisiveness are beginning to make me lose my grip. Do you understand?
$CUT_047_DISC_HANRIOT_022_JUDGE_MANI
Do I need to remind you that your fall could be as swift as your journey up the career ladder? A single order from me would be enough. Only one. Or even a few words spoken by a disappointed Danton or Hébert.
$CUT_047_DISC_HANRIOT_023_JUDGE_JOKE
I have been visited by a number of young and ambitious people lately, some of them officers. They came to ask for my support. Each and every one of them would be more than willing to gouge out their rival’s eyes for the position. To become the Commander-in-Chief of the National Guard would be a true honour…
$CUT_047_DISC_HANRIOT_024_JUDGE_HUMI
Danton and Hébert believe that I should not waste my time convincing you to help us. They say that I should threaten to dismiss you, or even send you to the guillotine. As far as they are concerned, accusations of Counter-Revolutionary activities can always be easily proven.
$CUT_047_DISC_HANRIOT_025_HANRIOT_DOUB
If I were to help you, it would be because of your wife, not your arguments. You are playing a dangerous game. One wrong move could lead to your death.
$CUT_047_DISC_HANRIOT_026_HANRIOT_IRRI
True, I would not have reached my current position without you, but you are a fool for thinking that it makes me your pawn. You do not have enough power to threaten me. Not you, not Hébert, and surely not Danton. Consider this my refusal. Goodbye!
$CUT_047_DISC_HANRIOT_027_HANRIOT_AGGR
Do you want me dead? No, I am not an idiot! Find another madman who is willing to die for you. I may have promised loyalty, but that does not mean I will sacrifice my own life!
$CUT_047_DISC_HANRIOT_TOPIC_01
The information is reliable.
$CUT_047_DISC_HANRIOT_TOPIC_02
Renard must answer for his crimes.
$CUT_047_DISC_HANRIOT_TOPIC_03
When Renard and Robespierre die, there will be a change in authority.
$CUT_047_DISC_HANRIOT_TOPIC_04
Hanriot’s dismissal is in our hands.
