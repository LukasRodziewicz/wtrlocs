Did you come to visit the English whore?
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_002_ELLIOTT
That’s the new code name they gave me in prison.
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_003_JUDGE
I am so sorry, Grace. The guards should not–
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_004_ELLIOTT
Oh, this whole Revolution of yours shouldn’t, but this is who you are.
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_005_ELLIOTT
If I ever get out of here, I will charge you triple.
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_006_ELLIOTT
What do you want?
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_007_JUDGE
To offer you absolution.
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_008_ELLIOTT
Since you came to offer it, you must want something in return. What?
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_009_JUDGE
Madame de Staël.
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_010_ELLIOTT
I’m not a panderer, sorry. The only thing I can currently give you is a rat that I killed yesterday.
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_011_ELLIOTT
I’m not feeling all that hungry recently.
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_012_JUDGE
Yet, you are the only person that can help me. That can help Paris.
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_013_ELLIOTT
Do you remember when someone stabbed you in the middle of the street and I stitched you up?
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_014_ELLIOTT
Did I still not help you enough?
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_010_JUDGE_AGGR
I must get to that bitch de Staël! I must see her in the dock, and you will provide evidence of her crime – whether it is true or not.
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_011_JUDGE_MANI
Every person can be accused of something. I want to know what Madame de Staël did, or could still do. And who else can I ask, if not another woman?
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_012_JUDGE_JOKE
No single Parisian is lacking evidence that can be used against them. Tell me, what can we charge her with when the need arises? I’m not asking for the truth, only something that would be convincing.
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_013_JUDGE_HUMI
We used to help each other in the past, let us do so again. Tell me what you have on de Staël, anything that would be worth the guillotine.
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_014_ELLIOTT_INTR
I would love to help, but I don’t have anything on de Staël. Absolutely nothing.
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_015_ELLIOTT_DOUB
I doubt you will find anything. De Staël is clean, that’s why women chose her.
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_016_ELLIOTT_IRRI
This time you may fail, as I don’t have anything on her. Moreover, even if I had something, I doubt anyone would believe in her guilt. Women think she’s a saint.
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_017_JUDGE_AGGR
You must have something! Do not lie to me!
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_018_JUDGE_MANI
I do not believe you are telling me the whole truth.
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_019_JUDGE_JOKE
Stop being so unapproachable, there are bars between us already.
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_020_JUDGE_HUMI
You have to help me. Only you can fix the situation.
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_021_ELLIOTT_INTR
Would you lie to achieve your goal?
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_022_ELLIOTT_DOUB
Ask however many times you wish. I can’t give you what you want, because I don’t have it.
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_023_ELLIOTT_IRRI
I can’t give you something that doesn’t exist. Don’t you understand what I’m saying?
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_024_JUDGE_AGGR
Maybe I should motivate you. Help me, and you will leave this place today.
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_025_JUDGE_MANI
Do you really wish to spend so many more months in this place? Help me, and I will help you.
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_026_JUDGE_JOKE
I will get to her – with or without you. Except with your help, the process will take less of our valuable time. You should help, too, as you are choosing between leaving this place immediately or after many, many months. Possibly never.
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_027_JUDGE_HUMI
Only I can get you out of here, people do not care for political prisoners any more. Do not sentence yourself to so many months of prison.
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_028_JUDGE_AGGR
De Staël does not know whom she attacked! She will regret it! She will pay like all the others who have tried to stab me in the back!
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_029_JUDGE_MANI
I cannot let her gain power at the expense of our city being brutally torn apart. If she is unable to sacrifice her ambitions in such a situation, then I find her a traitor. And I will not be blackmailed by a traitor.
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_030_JUDGE_JOKE
De Staël will get burned trying to blackmail me and the people who fight for the freedom of Paris. Though I would delight in making sure she stays in the fire for longer.
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_031_JUDGE_HUMI
De Staël uses the terrible situation in Paris to achieve her own political goals. I will not let her blackmail me and France.
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_032_ELLIOTT_INTR
Since there is no evidence of her crime, I’ll create it. Let me go, and I will arm you with a charge strong enough to destroy anyone. Even someone as innocent as de Staël.
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_033_ELLIOTT_DOUB
I will only help you because I don’t want to die here. I’ll hand you this precious evidence, but don’t count on it being entirely true.
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_034_ELLIOTT_IRRI
I am still strong enough to listen to my conscience and not betray other women. Who do you think I am? Do you want to break me? Many men before you made a similar attempt, and they failed too. You will all fail. We, women, shall prevail!
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_TOPIC_01
Give me something I can charge de Staël with.
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_TOPIC_02
I do not believe that de Staël is so innocent.
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_TOPIC_03
Help me, and you will be freed.
$DISC_INTR_005_B02_ELLIOTT_TOPIC_04
I will not be blackmailed.
