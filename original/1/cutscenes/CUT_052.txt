Good morning, Citizens.
$CUT_052_ROBESPIERRE_002
You did not hurry here, did you? A long night?
$CUT_052_MENTOR_003
Citizen Robespierre, to what do we owe–
$CUT_052_ROBESPIERRE_004
Vendée. There was a rebellion.
$CUT_052_JUDGE_005
What?! Who started it?
$CUT_052_ROBESPIERRE_006
People. Traitors. They are yelling that they have had enough of the terror, of the Revolution.
$CUT_052_ROBESPIERRE_007
But I know they are spies, paid for by our neighbours, to whom the Revolution is quite the inconvenience!
$CUT_052_ROBESPIERRE_008
Some say they want bread. Others that the clergy continues to oppress the people.
$CUT_052_MENTOR_009
And there are those who shout, “To hell with Robespierre’s terror”…
$CUT_052_ROBESPIERRE_010
You speak too freely, Citizen. Enough with the lenient verdicts, enough with indulgence!
$CUT_052_ROBESPIERRE_011
I will deal with Vendée myself, but I need the situation in Paris–
$CUT_052_ROBESPIERRE_012
And I need you to get rid of the undesirable, the element that undermines the sense of the Revolution.
$CUT_052_ROBESPIERRE_013
Fear will help them think more rationally, to believe in its message.
$CUT_052_ROBESPIERRE_014
You must bring peace to the capital city. Even if that means blood.
$CUT_052_JUDGE_015
And what about legal equality? Justice?
$CUT_052_ROBESPIERRE_016
Terror is nothing but swift justice.
