Thank you for accepting our invitation.
$TCUT_023_002_JUDGE
That’s why everyone hates aristocrats. I didn’t really feel like having a choice.
$TCUT_023_003_RENARD
Fair point. Thank you, anyway.
$TCUT_023_004_JUDGE
What a lovely residence. I’m glad that all that tribute money didn’t go to waste.
$TCUT_023_005_JUDGE
Why am I here?
$TCUT_023_006_RENARD
We wanted you to meet those who are pursued only because of their provenance.
$TCUT_023_007_RENARD
The wealthy are being oppressed just like the poor were in the past.
$TCUT_023_008_JUDGE
Aristocracy worked hard to be treated that way.
$TCUT_023_009_JUDGE
Everyone has a reason to hate you.
$TCUT_023_010_RENARD
The same propaganda slogans all over again.
$TCUT_023_011_RENARD
Once we’re finished with that Revolution, can we kill all those who are now trying to get rid of us?
$TCUT_023_012_JUDGE
Good luck. Maybe you will meet the ones who killed my child.
$TCUT_023_014_RENARD
I must admit that we weren’t entirely convinced whether we should take part in that murder, but the offer was just too tempting.
$TCUT_023_015_JUDGE
What is that supposed to mean?
$TCUT_023_016_RENARD
I personally think that our disguised partner overestimates you.
$TCUT_023_017_RENARD
Yet he wishes to cooperate with a judge of the Tribunal.
$TCUT_023_018_RENARD
He has also reassured us that he doesn’t intend to kill any other member of your family.
$TCUT_023_019_JUDGE
He killed my child?! You did that?!
$TCUT_023_020_RENARD
See how powerful we, the highborn, have become since you forced us to unite?
$TCUT_023_021_RENARD
We will play one single game of dice, you and I.
$TCUT_023_022_RENARD
We will play for the fate of the man who betrayed your family and helped us kill your child…
$TCUT_023_MINIGAME_YES_001_JUDGE
Fine, let’s play.
$TCUT_023_MINIGAME_YES_002_RENARD
A true fighting spirit. I like that!
$TCUT_023_MINIGAME_NO_001_JUDGE
I will not play your games, Renard.
$TCUT_023_MINIGAME_NO_002_RENARD
You are as weak and mediocre as your father.
$TCUT_023_MINIGAME_ROUND_01_COMM
Our masked friend was filled with rage. He offered us a very lucrative deal in exchange for our help. We agreed.
$TCUT_023_MINIGAME_ROUND_02_COMM
A dangerous, wounded man. Rejecting him would be unwise.
$TCUT_023_MINIGAME_ROUND_03_COMM
To have your child killed, he used information taken from a person that we indicated. From a man we have already collaborated with. What a fool.
$TCUT_023_MINIGAME_ROUND_04_COMM
We will bring you his head on a plate. This will be a token of our good will, and proof that it is wise to be our friend.
$TCUT_023_MINIGAME_ROUND_05_COMM
The aristocrats will proudly return to the city any day now, and every person who has not taken our side will be dealt with.
$TCUT_023_MINIGAME_JUDGE_WON
You won. We will keep our promise, and you will get that traitor’s head. And Paris… well, Paris will not be too happy.
$TCUT_023_MINIGAME_JUDGE_LOST
Sooner or later every gambler learns that he has no control whatsoever. He passively observes how time pushes him into failure. A deal is a deal. You lost, so we will not be telling you anything. And Paris… Paris shall get what it deserves.
