That Agent you asked me to silence yesterday… Well, I did, but there is something you should see.
$CUT_049_002_JUDGE
Do you want to show me a common dead body?
$CUT_049_003_GUARDSMAN
It’s not just a dead body. Look at that necklace.
$CUT_049_004_JUDGE
A fleur-de-lis.
$CUT_049_005_GUARDSMAN
There’s more hidden under his clothes.
$CUT_049_006_GUARDSMAN
We found a message in the inner pocket of his cloak.
$CUT_049_007_GUARDSMAN
It’s an order. Someone told that man to build support for a mysterious “R” in the district.
$CUT_049_008_JUDGE
Who is arrogant enough to take Louis’s place?
$CUT_049_009_GUARDSMAN
Only aristocrats are powerful enough to secretly organise people like him.
$CUT_049_010_JUDGE
Even they would need help from someone in the Convention. So who is “R”?
$CUT_049_011_GUARDSMAN
Robespierre maybe? If he’s allying with aristocrats, we must tell… someone, everyone!
$CUT_049_012_JUDGE
It could also be Minister Roland. As long as we are not sure, we would only create panic.
$CUT_049_013_GUARDSMAN
If that’s the case, we’ll have to hunt down other agents. This one won’t be telling us anything.
$CUT_049_014_JUDGE
We have no other choice.
$CUT_049_015_JUDGE
If this “R” is trying to gain support, you must do the same. For the greater good…
