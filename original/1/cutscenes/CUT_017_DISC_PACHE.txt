It is good to finally meet in person.
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_002_PACHE
I am truly sorry that you had to face such terror.
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_003_PACHE
If I only knew the bastard behind that despicable crime…
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_003_JUDGE_AGGR
I promised myself I will get the people who wanted to kill me. Who was it that dared? I will feed the guillotine with their blood.
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_004_JUDGE_MANI
These people prefer to act under the cover of darkness, which you and I also use often to satisfy our mundane needs. The night should remain in the possession of… the right people.
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_005_JUDGE_JOKE
My wife is pressing me to find the perpetrators. As for me, I would gladly go back to my duties. Do you understand me, Citizen?
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_006_JUDGE_HUMI
Perhaps the people of Paris have spoken through this attack, but it is more probable that it was planned by someone who does not love the Revolution as much as the two of us.
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_007_PACHE_SATI
It is absolutely understandable that you wish to get them.
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_008_PACHE_INTR
Yes, it was a horrible attack, and I would gladly find out who has the determination to dare such a thing.
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_009_PACHE_DOUB
I doubt the people you are looking for are here in Paris. They have either escaped or been killed by those who sent them. You will be chasing ghosts.
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_010_JUDGE_AGGR
I will move earth and sky to get them! I demand that the man who supposedly has power over this city truly shows that Paris is ruled by justice, and not criminals!
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_011_JUDGE_MANI
Everyone I asked told me that Jean-Nicolas Pache was not a man who would turn a blind eye to such vile acts. Are the people of Paris wrong?
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_012_JUDGE_JOKE
To be honest, I do not know why I chose you to assist me in searching for the perpetrators. You seemed to be the most friendly and empathetic of all candidates.
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_013_JUDGE_HUMI
Who else if not the mayor of this magnificent city could restore peace and order here? You are the only one who can stop the brutality that I have fallen victim to in the streets.
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_014_PACHE_SATI
I feel flattered by the fact that you see me as such an enlightened defender of the city.
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_015_PACHE_INTR
I see passion in your eyes. I cannot help but wonder what the two of us could achieve together.
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_016_PACHE_DOUB
As I have told you before, I feel sorry for you. Though let us leave this to the professionals, as we have more important issues to discuss.
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_017_PACHE_IRRI
Your companion, François Hanriot, would be able to help more with this matter. Yes, I know about your little alliance. I can therefore suspect that you are not being entirely honest with me, Citizen Fidèle.
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_018_JUDGE_AGGR
I do not know if someone who has morals and values should accept a greater reward than making amends to the poor and meting out justice to criminals.
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_019_JUDGE_MANI
The people who attacked me are even now strolling around Paris and could attack anyone. It is scary to think what could happen if they are hired by someone who, for instance, could plan a similar assault on the mayor of Paris.
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_020_JUDGE_JOKE
These people are dead, it has already been decided. Nevertheless, instead of killing some random suspects, I would rather get the right people on the first attempt.
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_021_JUDGE_HUMI
The future of this country will be determined by our fortitude. And do we deserve to be praised by the people if we remain indifferent to their lamentations? These assassins are a threat to all inhabitants.
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_022_JUDGE_AGGR
If your help has a price, then so be it. I will pay you a percentage of the profits from the establishment we confiscated from Madame Roland. You will be one of us.
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_023_JUDGE_MANI
Madame Roland’s facility needs reliable managers. Otherwise, it might be used for wicked purposes, or even turned against us. And if I could share the profits with you…
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_024_JUDGE_JOKE
The brothel that we have taken away from Madame Roland will make enough profit for us all, and I can share it with you. After all, we are supposed to become friends.
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_025_JUDGE_HUMI
I would not ask someone as good as you for help without giving you something in return. Madame Roland made a nice place for herself, Jean, and you will get your share of the profits.
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_026_JUDGE_AGGR
This alliance is something that we both need. Nobody rejects the judge of the Tribunal’s outstretched hand. I will not accept your refusal.
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_027_JUDGE_MANI
Catching the assassins is just the beginning. Thanks to this alliance, you may become the most powerful man in Paris. I will gladly help you.
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_028_JUDGE_JOKE
It is a real pleasure to know that I can get back to my duties when a good man like you is taking care of my safety. This alliance is a good thing indeed. Please, do me this favour.
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_029_JUDGE_HUMI
Do me the honour of acknowledging our friendship and alliance. Together we will find the assassins and make Paris a more peaceful place.
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_030_PACHE_SATI
I will accept your help, because this alliance will make a better life for us and all Parisians!
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_031_PACHE_INTR
Too bad we did not meet earlier, you are such an intriguing man. Let us join forces.
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_032_PACHE_DOUB
You have taken great pains to convince me. I am not saying you have fully succeeded, but… well, have it your way. I will take the risk.
$CUT_017_DISC_PACHE_033_PACHE_IRRI
You have not mastered the art of oratory well enough to hide your real motives. Are you trying to involve me in something? Perhaps you plan to kill me? I do not know, but I doubt you have good intentions. Your death will be a gift for me. Gentlemen?
