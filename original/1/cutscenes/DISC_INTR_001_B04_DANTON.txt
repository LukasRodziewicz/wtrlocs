Roland is a rotten louse. Corruption cannot become the hallmark of the new authorities.
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_DANTON_002_JUDGE_MANI
Does Roland really represent the people? Or is he instead working to the benefit of Capet and his servants?
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_DANTON_003_JUDGE_JOKE
We need to get rid of Roland for his own good. His pockets will soon burst apart from the amount of money he keeps in them.
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_DANTON_004_JUDGE_HUMI
France is bleeding and people like Roland will not let it heal its wounds. On the contrary, they only make them deeper.

Nothing would make me happier than the death of that leech, but I do not understand why it is so important to you.
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_DANTON_006_DANTON_INTR
I did not think that anyone outside the Convention would be so interested in his fall.
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_DANTON_007_DANTON_DOUB
Roland is a leech, but he is also a minister and a deputy chosen by the people.
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_DANTON_008_JUDGE_AGGR
Roland is not only guilty of bribes. He threatened a Judge of the Revolutionary Tribunal. The independent judiciary!
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_DANTON_009_JUDGE_MANI
In order to avoid punishment, Roland started a vendetta against me. By doing so, did he not declare war on the new order?
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_DANTON_010_JUDGE_JOKE
Mr and Mrs Roland are two mosquitoes, biting me, draining the blood of France. Nobody likes mosquitoes.
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_DANTON_011_JUDGE_HUMI
My own antipathy towards the minister does not change the fact that we should replace this corrupt Royalist with someone more just.
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_DANTON_012_JUDGE_AGGR
If you do not persuade the deputies, it will be proof that you tolerate the traitors who are still exercising their influence throughout France!
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_DANTON_013_JUDGE_MANI
If the deputies see that you want Roland to be gone, maybe they will stop suspecting you of being a Royalist?
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_DANTON_014_JUDGE_JOKE
The Girondins often trip over their own feet. You need only give them a gentle push.
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_DANTON_015_JUDGE_HUMI
There are times when Roland is closer to the Ancien Régime than Louis. If you want to be rid of the old order, now is your chance.
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_DANTON_016_DANTON_SATI
Weakening the Girondins is in France’s best interest. These days, we cannot afford people of mild views, and we will never tolerate those who are corrupt. I will not allow it!
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_DANTON_017_DANTON_INTR
The dominance of the Jacobins would be a pleasant thing. It would make ruling over the country so much easier and France would get up off its knees. Fine, I will help.
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_DANTON_018_DANTON_DOUB
The Girondins are losing power anyway. I will wait until they fall.

What do we want to achieve?

Why do we want it?

What will he get out of it?
