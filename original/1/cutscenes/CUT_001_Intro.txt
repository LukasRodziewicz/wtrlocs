Father.
$CUT_001_002
I am here.
$CUT_001_003
Do you hear me?
$CUT_001_004
I gave you the best I could.
$CUT_001_005
Why did you disown me?
$CUT_001_006
I have your blood in my veins. How could you?
$CUT_001_007
Do I mean nothing to you?
$CUT_001_008
Why do you grieve for him? He was nothing.
$CUT_001_009
I am better than he was. People will follow in my footsteps.

Father…
