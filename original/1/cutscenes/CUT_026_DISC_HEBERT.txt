Who are you talking to? You would be happy to hand power over to people who cannot even read properly!
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_002_HEBERT
What, so you’re saying that the poor are only good to die at the front?
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_003_DANTON
Perhaps it is the destiny of the Paris Commune to be shot at in order to protect others?
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_004_HEBERT
How dare you!
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_005_JUDGE
Gentlemen, we met here to make an alliance. We must, since we are all burdened by weaknesses that Robespierre does not have.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_006_JUDGE_AGGR
Robespierre’s paranoia has done enough harm already. It is our duty to eliminate such rabid vermin!
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_007_JUDGE_MANI
It would seem that Robespierre’s madness has completely taken control of his mind. Somebody must stop him.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_008_JUDGE_JOKE
Perhaps his paranoia will whisper into his ear that he is a threat to himself. Maybe the lunatic will even have himself guillotined?
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_009_JUDGE_HUMI
Robespierre is an unpredictable lunatic. Every French Citizen should be afraid of him.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_010_HEBERT_DOUB
France has survived ages of dictatorship, it will survive Robespierre as well.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_011_HEBERT_IRRI
Is Robespierre the only maniac in Paris?
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_012_HEBERT_AGGR
And you?! You want to win me over for your own ends. You are no better than him!
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_013_DANTON
Why do we even talk to the boor?
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_014_JUDGE_AGGR
If you attack Robespierre alone, you will lose. You cannot escape that painful truth.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_015_JUDGE_MANI
There is a reason Robespierre has reached the top. Many have tried to knock him down, and they have all lost. You will lose too if you face him alone.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_016_JUDGE_JOKE
You think your position is strong enough to attack Robespierre. The truth is, without us you do not stand a chance.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_017_JUDGE_HUMI
Even together we can hardly match Robespierre’s power. Do not put your head into the lion’s mouth, as he will devour you without remorse.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_018_DANTON
Alexis is right. On our own, each of us are easy prey.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_019_HEBERT_INTR
Do you know something that I do not?
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_020_HEBERT_DOUB
Even if I lose, I will be able to discuss terms with him.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_021_HEBERT_IRRI
I’m not stupid, I know that Robespierre is dangerous. But your underestimation of me is far worse!
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_022_HEBERT_AGGR
Fools! I am not as weak as you think!
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_027_JUDGE_AGGR
And yet you recruited a converted archbishop as an ally! You would have to be stupid to believe Gobel would be a loyal partner. He is far more likely to join Robespierre than stay with you.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_028_JUDGE_MANI
Gobel will betray you at the first opportunity because it is much better for him to join forces with Robespierre. They both hate the rule of reason, but Gobel has yet to reveal this to you.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_029_JUDGE_JOKE
Gobel will betray you as he has betrayed me. Robespierre simply has more to offer than any of us.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_030_JUDGE_HUMI
Gobel will betray you. You will push him into Robespierre’s arms yourself. He listened to his instinct when he resigned the holy orders. And when your struggle against Robespierre reaches a turning point, as soon as the situation gets tricky, he will do it again.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_031_JUDGE_AGGR
Do not waste your time on Gobel, you cannot control him. We have a better candidate for a scapegoat, one we actually can control. I am speaking of prosecutor Tinville.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_032_JUDGE_MANI
If you go with us, we will use someone better than Gobel, someone we can control – prosecutor Tinville.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_033_JUDGE_JOKE
Let us replace Gobel with prosecutor Tinville. He will be our scapegoat.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_034_JUDGE_HUMI
Let us say that I have influence on someone, who will make a better scapegoat than Gobel – prosecutor Tinville.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_035_DANTON
I will resign from my post in the Committee of Public Safety and propose that Tinville should replace me. Robespierre will turn his attention to him and we will gain some freedom to act.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_036_HEBERT_INTR
Tinville is a prosecutor and enjoys a good reputation among the people. It is possible that Robespierre could see him as a rival for the position of the highest statesman of France.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_037_HEBERT_DOUB
And Tinville will so easily agree to join the crusade against Robespierre?
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_038_HEBERT_IRRI
It makes me shiver to think that you are able to sacrifice this man without a second thought. I do not believe he would consent to this.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_039_HEBERT_AGGR
You are a real beast, Fidèle. Gobel was right, and Tinville may realise that at any moment.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_040_JUDGE_AGGR
Tinville is a blood-sucker. We will paint a nice picture of power to him and let him revel in it. That should stop him being suspicious of our intentions.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_041_JUDGE_MANI
All I have to do is show him that power is within his reach. Tinville wants it as much as we do.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_042_JUDGE_JOKE
I will talk him into this, there is no need to worry. Tinville wants nothing more than a career and he is not satisfied with what he already has.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_043_JUDGE_HUMI
Tinville wants power, and I am going to convince him that he will get it. I will humiliate myself to make him believe so that his pride will be flattered by having a judge of the Tribunal at his service.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_044_DANTON
It might work. Strict cooperation and trust will be the key to conquering Robespierre.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_045_HEBERT_INTR
All right, let us get rid of Robespierre once and for all!
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_046_HEBERT_DOUB
Fine, but do not count on my unconditional trust. I will be watching you. Closely.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_047_HEBERT_IRRI
Your arguments are poor. Find yourself another “ally”.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_048_HEBERT_AGGR
You have wasted my time. Did you really think I would fraternise with such corrupted charlatans as you?
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_TOPIC_01
Robespierre is a dangerous maniac.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_TOPIC_02
Hébert will lose if he has no allies.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_TOPIC_03
Gobel will gain more by discussing terms with Robespierre.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_TOPIC_04
Let us go together and use the ambitious Tinville as our scapegoat.
$CUT_026_DISC_HEBERT_TOPIC_05
Tinville wants a career.
