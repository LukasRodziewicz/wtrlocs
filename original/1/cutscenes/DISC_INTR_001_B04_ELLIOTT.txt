Roland is a rotten louse. Corruption cannot become the hallmark of the new authorities.
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_ELLIOTT_002_JUDGE_MANI
Does Roland really represent the people? Or is he instead working to the benefit of Capet and his servants?
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_ELLIOTT_003_JUDGE_JOKE
We need to get rid of Roland for his own good. His pockets will soon burst apart from the amount of money he keeps in them.

France is bleeding and people like Roland will not let it heal its wounds. On the contrary, they only make them deeper.

Who could have thought you would turn from a sheep into a wolf and so intuitively smell wounded prey that quickly?

We know the Rolands. Madame Roland’s in charge and her husband fulfils her orders. Maybe it’s not him who’s guilty?

I survived in this city mostly because I didn’t take part in the dirty games played by men.

Roland is not only guilty of bribes. He threatened a Judge of the Revolutionary Tribunal. The independent judiciary!
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_ELLIOTT_009_JUDGE_MANI
In order to avoid punishment, Roland started a vendetta against me. By doing so, did he not declare war on the new order?
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_ELLIOTT_010_JUDGE_JOKE
Mr and Mrs Roland are two mosquitoes, biting me, draining the blood of France. Nobody likes mosquitoes.

My own antipathy towards the minister does not change the fact that we should replace this corrupt Royalist with someone more just.
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_ELLIOTT_012_JUDGE_AGGR
If you do not persuade the deputies, it will be proof that you tolerate the traitors who are still exercising their influence throughout France!
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_ELLIOTT_013_JUDGE_MANI
If the deputies see that you want Roland to be gone, maybe they will stop suspecting you of being a Royalist?

The Girondins often trip over their own feet. You need only give them a gentle push.
$DISC_INTR_001_B04_ELLIOTT_015_JUDGE_HUMI
There are times when Roland is closer to the Ancien Régime than Louis. If you want to be rid of the old order, now is your chance.

At first, I wasn’t sure about fighting against Minister Roland, but I must say that you’ve managed to convince me. This can work, and I will help you.

My friends and I won’t benefit from an attempt to remove the Minister of Internal Affairs.

Roland is not France’s biggest problem, hungry Citizens are!

What will she get out of it?
