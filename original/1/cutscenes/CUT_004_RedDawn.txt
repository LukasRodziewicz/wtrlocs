A bloody beginning. A violent prologue announced by a flowing red curtain.

The wrath of strangers made me sick to my stomach. Feet stirred dark puddles. The air tasted like iron.

“Their heads!” someone cried.

Anger hidden in the shadows. Thousands of cries from a single throat. Here was a beast with hundreds of claws and teeth.

A kicked, abused, and physically wounded soul.

“Their heads!” What a cold and urgent order. The beast’s eyes showed a long-disguised bitterness. Yesterday’s envy.

The beast’s bark was filled with a thousand smiles of those who worshipped this bloody morning.
$CUT_004_009
The day when their enemies will perish.

Their brothers.
