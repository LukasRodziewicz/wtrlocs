When will we finally get rid of those holy hypocrites?
$CUT_22_SPEECH_002_CROWD
Tell us, monsieur le juge!
$CUT_22_SPEECH_003_CROWD
When will Tinville drive them into a corner?
$CUT_22_SPEECH_004_JUDGE_AGGR
Be angry, be ruthless! If someone’s head needs to be impaled – do it! It is your city, your country!
$CUT_22_SPEECH_005_JUDGE_MANI
Look what they made you do. You had to take to the streets to make them see you. You have every right to be angry, and they should be terrified when their end is fast approaching!
$CUT_22_SPEECH_006_JUDGE_JOKE
Do you really think your unhappy faces bother them? If you want them to be scared, you must approach them with clenched fists and torches held high.
$CUT_22_SPEECH_007_JUDGE_HUMI
I know what you are feeling and I am with you. Those people who are safely nestled in their marble buildings and dressed in expensive garments are the source of your misery!
$CUT_22_SPEECH_008_JUDGE_AGGR
These parasites were living off your hard work, your blood and sweat! Enough! The Revolution was supposed to make us all equal, yet the clergy once again looks down on us! Vendée has proven that!
$CUT_22_SPEECH_009_JUDGE_MANI
The clergy has done nothing for you, they have always been living for themselves. They need the rebellion in Vendée to get their power back.
$CUT_22_SPEECH_010_JUDGE_JOKE
Do you really need the people who refuse to defend your faith, and instead just disgust you?
$CUT_22_SPEECH_011_JUDGE_HUMI
Citizens, you have paid too much for your freedom and equality to hand them over to someone who will not allow you to ever fight again.
$CUT_22_SPEECH_012_JUDGE_AGGR
Every group of traitors is led by a single man. This is no exception. Archbishop Gobel is waiting until civil war weakens France, only so he can crown himself at the right moment! He wishes to bring the old way of things back!
$CUT_22_SPEECH_013_JUDGE_MANI
Archbishop Gobel is another embodiment of that evil which you yourself have overthrown! He spies, incites, and harasses everyone who stands in his way!
$CUT_22_SPEECH_014_JUDGE_JOKE
If Gobel was really worried about you, he would have been satisfied with just preaching. But he would rather see rebellions and a return to the old way of things.
$CUT_22_SPEECH_015_JUDGE_HUMI
Do not let them turn all your hard work to ashes, because people like Gobel will rise from it to rule you on behalf of the pope.
$CUT_22_SPEECH_016_JUDGE_AGGR
Demand that he tells you the truth about his illegitimate child! Demand that he tells you about his involvement in the unrest at Vendée and the start of the civil war!
$CUT_22_SPEECH_017_JUDGE_MANI
Are you really going to let the truth about the archbishop’s illegitimate child disappear under the pile of sermons about a virtuous life? Will you let the clergy support civil wars instead of the faithful?
$CUT_22_SPEECH_018_JUDGE_JOKE
Did you hear the rumours about the archbishop’s illegitimate child? Then ask him. I wonder what stories he will tell you instead.
$CUT_22_SPEECH_019_JUDGE_HUMI
France cannot afford priests who have illegitimate children, or Archbishops who are involved in civil wars. Tell him that.
$CUT_22_SPEECH_020_JUDGE
Rise!
$CUT_22_SPEECH_TOPIC_01
I know how angry you are. It is their fault.
$CUT_22_SPEECH_TOPIC_02
They have lived off your hard work for so many years. And they still do!
$CUT_22_SPEECH_TOPIC_03
Gobel is the worst among liars.
$CUT_22_SPEECH_TOPIC_04
Go to him. Demand that he tells you the truth!
