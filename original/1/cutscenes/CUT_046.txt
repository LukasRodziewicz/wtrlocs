$CUT_046_JUDGE_002

You are already fighting with Robespierre…
$CUT_046_JUDGE_004
Renard has been our enemy for as long as I can remember.
$CUT_046_JUDGE_005
I finally understand that I should have focused on him from the start. I should have killed him.

$CUT_046_JUDGE_007

$CUT_046_RAMEL_008

$CUT_046_JUDGE_009
What, did you find your conscience all of a sudden?
$CUT_046_RAMEL_010
I am going to help you.
$CUT_046_RAMEL_011
