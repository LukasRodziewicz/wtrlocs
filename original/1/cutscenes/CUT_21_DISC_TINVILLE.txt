$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_001_JUDGE
Please forgive me being a little late.
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_002_TINVILLE
You have only piqued my curiosity, monsieur le juge, as I cannot guess what I have done to deserve this invitation.
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_003_JUDGE
You must have heard the rumours about Archbishop Gobel…
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_004_TINVILLE
Come now, Alexis, you are poking fun at my intelligence. We both know that you are the author of the denunciation…
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_005_JUDGE
How can you be so sure?
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_006_TINVILLE
I am not a fool. You have eliminated Roland and Pache, and now you are trying to get Gobel. The reason why may elude me, but I do not care…
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_007_JUDGE_AGGR
As long as your balance of profits is positive. There are some people, however, who care about justice.
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_008_JUDGE_MANI
Yes, I know. You will secure your profit under any circumstances. Believe me, the benefits of playing this game may well go beyond our imagination.
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_009_JUDGE_JOKE
Yes, we know what you care about most. I do not judge you, Gobel is no different. The question is, who will be the first to meet the guillotine for being so selfish?
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_010_JUDGE_HUMI
I am turning to you with this issue because you convinced me of your wisdom during the trials. We cannot let Gobel deceive the French people with his tales of virtue and restraint while he is guilty of such misdeeds.
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_011_TINVILLE_DOUB
What do I care about anyone’s bastard? The country is in flames because of the rebellion in Vendée, and I am supposed to be preoccupied with something like this? An illegitimate child in Paris – now that truly is a novelty…
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_012_TINVILLE_IRRI
If Gobel has trodden on your toes, that is your business. I see no reason to cross perhaps the most influential figure in this city. Precisely because of the balance of profits and losses.
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_013_JUDGE_AGGR
You have seen what is going on in the street. All this hatred must find an outlet. And are you going to wait because it does not pay off to make the effort? And if the mob puts your head on a pike, will you record it as a profit or a loss?
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_014_JUDGE_MANI
Gobel is not stupid, he is interpreting the moods correctly. He knows it is safe to now place himself on the side of the righteous, and this requires pushing someone else to the other side. Can you be sure he will not pick you?
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_015_JUDGE_JOKE
You must be the toughest man in Paris. You are not bothered by the mob, which has once again decided that cutting the heads off dignitaries would be fashionable. It is enough for Gobel to shout from his pulpit that you are enjoying yourself in a brothel for public money instead of prosecuting law-breakers, and before you know it, your head will be gone.
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_016_JUDGE_HUMI
I believe in your reason. Listen here, Gobel has possessed the souls of thousands of Parisians who are looking for someone to answer for the rebellion in the Vendée and the south. They need to find someone who is guilty, and you are surely too much a man of sense to leave the choice to fate.
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_017_TINVILLE_SATI
You surely have the gift of persuasion. I am listening.
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_018_TINVILLE_INTR
Your words do make some sense. These days, people are indeed full of negative thoughts.
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_019_TINVILLE_DOUB
Your concern for my career and life is moving. Nevertheless, I do not think I have a reason to worry about any of the threats you have mentioned. I serve France well, and France knows it.
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_020_TINVILLE_IRRI
If I did not know you, I would say you speak like a noble man. Unfortunately, I know you well enough to realise there is more to your words than you are saying.
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_021_JUDGE_AGGR
You care about your career, do not deny it. Nobody can gain advancement in this city without the knowledge and approval of the Archbishop. You will be kissing the ring of a man who is even more an opportunist than you are!
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_022_JUDGE_MANI
If you hope for a quick promotion, you can forget about it. You have reached a point where your advancement will depend on people like him. You will do him favours, and he will charge you higher prices than I do. Instead, you could show your strength, suggest that you are the one to shape your own fate.
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_023_JUDGE_JOKE
Show that you have grown to become more than a mere prosecutor. It seems to me that you do not care this man is about to take control over your career, and that to the city you are just another lawyer, like so many others. And I wanted to give you a chance to become someone important…
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_024_JUDGE_HUMI
You deserve a much higher position than that of a prosecutor – you could become a symbol of justice. But Gobel will not let you rise. He does not care for your talent. The only thing that interests him is how deep your spine can bend when you bow before him.
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_025_JUDGE_AGGR
Gobel is a lecherous scumbag. If we officially announce the investigation, we will give him a chance to do the right thing, and if he will not – off with his head!
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_026_JUDGE_MANI
Everyone should be offered the chance to redeem themselves, especially a Catholic like Gobel. We must reveal this before someone else tries to use it against France.
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_027_JUDGE_JOKE
If Gobel is innocent, the investigation will prove it, true? If he is not, he will have the chance to do the right thing and everyone will be happy.
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_028_JUDGE_HUMI
Every Catholic should get the chance to redeem themselves. As an archbishop, Gobel should do this openly to console the hurt Parisian souls, and maybe even save the lives of many innocent people.
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_029_TINVILLE_SATI
Yes, yes, I am already convinced. I will see what can be done.
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_030_TINVILLE_INTR
I must say that your arguments are quite convincing. I will look into this subject.
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_031_TINVILLE_DOUB
There is something that you are not telling me, and I will not look into Gobel if I am not fully convinced. I have too much at risk.
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_032_TINVILLE_IRRI
There is something that you are not telling me. What did he do to make you this furious? Actually, spare me the details. In these times it is better to be ignorant.
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_033_TINVILLE_DOUB_IRRI
Be aware that you did not handle this well. Then again, I would not want you to think that I have a heart of stone, so let us play! If you win, I will lead an official investigation against Gobel. You may have forgotten how to be sly, but maybe luck has not deserted you yet.
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_034_TINVILLE_WIN
Maybe it is a good thing that fortune is on your side. After all, you want to go against Gobel.
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_035_TINVILLE_DEFEAT
It would seem that even fortune is not on your side, but I will take the liberty to ignore your instigation. There will be no official investigation.
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_TOPIC_001
If Gobel has a child, we should reveal his hypocrisy.
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_TOPIC_002
These days, we should make an effort to show who is just and who is not…
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_TOPIC_003
He has a huge following.
$CUT_21_DISC_TINVILLE_TOPIC_004
Gobel should get a chance to do the right thing.
