Do you know that young soldier who came to the rescue?
$CUT_035_BROTHER_002
His name is Napoleon Bonaparte.
$CUT_035_JUDGE_003
I don’t know him. But that’s not important. I won. Paris stays in our hands.
$CUT_035_BROTHER_004
You won? I never wanted to take over the city.
$CUT_035_JUDGE_005
I don’t understand.
$CUT_035_BROTHER_006
I’ve just introduced you to your new dictator.
$CUT_035_BROTHER_007
I won.
$CUT_035_BROTHER_008
People will greet Napoleon with open arms.
$CUT_035_BROTHER_009
The “new” will come, only to forget about you and once again flood the country in blood after a hundred years.
$CUT_035_BROTHER_010
At this very moment the “new” is entering the city, leading an undefeated army.
$CUT_035_BROTHER_011
I won.
$CUT_035_JUDGE_012
Not as long as I’m alive, no.
$CUT_035_BROTHER_013
I have a pistol on me.
$CUT_035_JUDGE_014
Why don’t we settle which one of us is favoured by God – Cain or Abel?
$CUT_035_BROTHER_015
The favoured shall kill the loser?
$CUT_035_JUDGE_016
Shooting him in the head.
$CUT_035_ROLL_01
You thought that the Revolution will free you, but it was nothing more than a wish.
$CUT_035_ROLL_03
You have all believed in this romantic rebellion. Tell me, how did that Revolution differ from what we are doing now?
$CUT_035_ROLL_05
Did she not become a fight to the death, a chaotic game with only one currency – chance?
