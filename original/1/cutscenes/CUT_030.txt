$CUT_030_001_JUDGE
Your eyes were never so empty.
$CUT_030_002_JUDGE
But today… I want you to be proud of me.
$CUT_030_003_THUG
Come with me, monsieur le juge.
$CUT_030_004_JUDGE
Son!
$CUT_030_005_BROTHER
Welcome… brother.
$CUT_030_006_BROTHER
You were in the dark for so long.
$CUT_030_007_JUDGE
Bruno? Is that really you? How… how is it even possible?
$CUT_030_008_BROTHER
You were told what you were supposed to think.
$CUT_030_009_BROTHER
I had to die as our father’s favourite son so that I could be born again.
$CUT_030_010_BROTHER
As his nemesis.
$CUT_030_011_JUDGE
I don’t understand… What is the meaning of all this?
$CUT_030_012_BROTHER
I returned to take away everything I have lost because of you. Family, happiness…
$CUT_030_013_BROTHER
While you have been leading a comfortable domestic life, I was crawling in the mud of a battlefield.
$CUT_030_014_JUDGE
We all thought you were dead.
$CUT_030_015_BROTHER
It was much easier that way, wasn’t it? I was dead and have been through hell, dear brother.
$CUT_030_016_BROTHER
Paris abandoned me, every door closed at the mere sound of my name.
$CUT_030_017_BROTHER
That was when hell reached for me.
$CUT_030_018_BROTHER
I enrolled in the army, hoping for a noble death.
$CUT_030_019_BROTHER
Instead, I was captured. Taken. And I suffered.
$CUT_030_020_BROTHER
The enemies played a game of dice with me.
$CUT_030_021_BROTHER
If I won, I would be free.
$CUT_030_022_BROTHER
But for each round lost, I would also lose a hand.
$CUT_030_023_BROTHER
I won the first one…
$CUT_030_024_BROTHER
… but the second…
$CUT_030_025_BROTHER
I was able to escape, then started planning my revenge – on our family, our father.
$CUT_030_026_BROTHER
On everyone who had disowned me.
$CUT_030_027_JUDGE
Revenge? On us? You should lay the blame on Clément Renard, he was the one to–
$CUT_030_028_BROTHER
I blame you all! Father, you, France…
$CUT_030_029_JUDGE
You want to hurt your own family?!
$CUT_030_030_BROTHER
You disowned me! As God disowned Cain.
$CUT_030_031_BROTHER
Father abandoned his own son, and you did not even try to defend me.
$CUT_030_032_JUDGE
I was young…
$CUT_030_033_BROTHER
Now you are an adult, and our father will watch your fall from grace – as far down as you can go.
$CUT_030_034_BROTHER
He will eventually abandon you, as he did me.
$CUT_030_035_BROTHER
I have realised that death will not hurt him as much,
$CUT_030_036_BROTHER
as watching his other son reach the bottom and become a villain too.
$CUT_030_037_BROTHER
And you did extremely well. You destroyed them.
$CUT_030_038_BROTHER
The Rolands.
$CUT_030_039_BROTHER
Pache and his daughter.
$CUT_030_040_BROTHER
Gobel and his bastard son.
$CUT_030_041_BROTHER
And now Robespierre.
$CUT_030_042_BROTHER
You did everything according to my plan. All I needed to do was awaken your desire for power.
$CUT_030_043_BROTHER
I made sure that you would fall with me, right before father's eyes.
$CUT_030_044_BROTHER
Now he will see that we are equal.
$CUT_030_045_JUDGE
Was my son’s death also part of your plan?
$CUT_030_046_BROTHER
I executed him through the hands of Renard and your beloved mentor.
$CUT_030_047_BROTHER
I visited him and made him believe the story of his imprisoned son.
$CUT_030_048_BROTHER
Then, he also became one of us. A villain.
$CUT_030_049_BROTHER
He helped me to kill your child in order to save his own.
$CUT_030_050_BROTHER
See, I needed my own revolution.
$CUT_030_051_BROTHER
A place for people you call criminals, because they do not fit in your society.
$CUT_030_052_BROTHER
I lead an army of outcasts in Paris.
$CUT_030_053_BROTHER
An army of the sons and daughters left behind after you decapitated their mothers.
$CUT_030_054_BROTHER
People who have lost everything because of the Revolution and were expelled, forced to move to a foreign land.
$CUT_030_055_BROTHER
In a few days, we will attack Paris and build a new home on its ruins. A place where a father will always keep an eye on both his sons.
$CUT_030_056_JUDGE
Are you insane?!
$CUT_030_057_BROTHER
Wait until you hear what I intend to do with your second son…
$CUT_030_058_JUDGE
He has not done anything!
$CUT_030_059_BROTHER
He must pay for the sins of his father – everyone must, just as I paid for the cowardice of ours.
$CUT_030_060_BROTHER
We will play two rounds of dice.
$CUT_030_061_BROTHER
Each round you lose, he will lose a hand.
$CUT_030_062_BROTHER
That is the same price I had to pay, and now it’s your son’s turn.
$CUT_030_063_BROTHER
The price is suitable for the sins you are guilty of.
$CUT_030_064_JUDGE
Ramel… my friend.
$CUT_030_065_JUDGE
He saved me.
$CUT_030_066_JUDGE
He saved my son.
$CUT_030_067_JUDGE
But he could not save what has already broken into a million pieces.
$CUT_030_068_JUDGE
Her eyes were not empty.
$CUT_030_069_JUDGE
Her eyes…
