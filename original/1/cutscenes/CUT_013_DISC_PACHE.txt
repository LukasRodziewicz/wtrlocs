Danton, you traitor! How could you…
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_START_002_JUDGE
Hello, Pache.
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_START_003_PACHE
Fidèle. Thank you for coming at such short notice.
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_START_004_PACHE
Danton betrayed me.
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_START_005_PACHE
Danton… We used to be allies.
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_START_006_PACHE
I asked for his help, but he never came. You did.
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_START_007_JUDGE
We are friends, Jean.
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_START_008_PACHE
I must destroy him, make him pay! We must.
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_001_JUDGE_AGGR
Who is the bastard that dared to raise his hand against a servant of the state? And for what reasons?
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_002_JUDGE_MANI
What did they accuse you of? It must have been something only your friends know. Someone like Danton. What did you become involved with, Jean?
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_003_JUDGE_JOKE
There has surely been a mistake. Do not worry, you will be home again before supper.
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_004_JUDGE_HUMI
I don’t understand. What do they accuse you of? You, of all people, when everyone knows that Paris blooms under your direction.
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_005_PACHE_INTR
Treason. That is all I have been able to establish. I do not know anything about the source of those accusations or possible evidence. Though I do know that Danton is not rushing to help me. He has betrayed me, and must be involved in this!
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_006_PACHE_DOUBT
Apparently I betrayed France. I am not a saint, I know, but treason?! And who is accusing me? That political whore Danton? I do not know for sure, but I can feel that he was involved in those accusations.
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_007_JUDGE_AGGR
If that sly serpent is responsible for your troubles, you must act now. You cannot wait for tomorrow’s trial. Do you have any proof of Danton’s misdeeds that could help?
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_008_JUDGE_MANI
If Danton made this attack, he must have fabricated evidence against you. We need to have something to fight back. What proof of his misdeeds do you have?
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_009_JUDGE_JOKE
I do not believe that you would enter an alliance with Danton without having some proof of his misdeeds. Tell me, do you have any documents that could be used against him?
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_010_JUDGE_HUMI
If anyone deserves to be decapitated, it is Danton – for pretending to be your friend. We need to fight him. You must have some proof of his misdeeds that we could use against him.
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_011_PACHE_INTR
What made you come to me? Why would you risk meeting a traitor? Why, Fidèle? Forget about loyalty and let me die. I deserve this punishment.
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_012_PACHE_DOUBT
I cannot do it any more, I no longer have the strength to fight it. The whole Revolution, the never-ending plots. It is impossible for me to trust anyone… Except you. I do not understand anything any more.
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_013_PACHE_IRRI
Are you planning to betray me too? You cannot! I thought, no, I hoped that it would be possible to find a true friend in this city.
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_014_JUDGE_AGGR
Wake up, Jean! There is no time for hesitation or melancholy! If I am supposed to make a counter-attack on Danton, I need to have something I can use. Let me help you and tell me where to look for it.
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_015_JUDGE_MANI
Once the trial begins, your fate will be set. If there is any evidence for treason, the accused cannot be saved. I can, however, make sure that evidence will never be disclosed. But to do that I need to have proof of Danton’s misdeeds. That is the only way. Where do you keep it, Jean?
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_016_JUDGE_JOKE
If you want to pity yourself, be my guest. Just remember that the Tribunal cannot let traitors go free. If you do not give me any proof of Danton’s misdeeds I will not be able to help you, and you will be dead by tomorrow.
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_017_JUDGE_HUMI
Oh, my dear Jean. I cannot let you die for a crime you have not committed. I shall save you and your legacy, but to do that, I need to force Danton to withdraw the accusations. Tell me, where are you keeping the proof of his misdeeds?
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_018_JUDGE_AGGR
Stop snivelling, not all is lost! You have a secret advantage – a judge of the Tribunal who is willing to help. We are allies. You can trust me.
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_019_JUDGE_MANI
Nobody will openly object to Danton, knowing that he can fabricate evidence of treason. They are scared. I, however, am willing to stick my neck out because I believe in the long-term benefits of our friendship. That alone should convince you.
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_020_JUDGE_JOKE
If you cannot trust me, even though I came here, then who can you trust? I do not see a crowd of people volunteering to save your neck.
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_021_JUDGE_HUMI
Jean, listen to the voice of reason. Every minute brings you closer to death, and there is nothing you can do while imprisoned here. I am offering help. Take it.
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_022_PACHE_INTR
Really? You will help me? I did something horrible in the past. Someone forced me to do it, and now I am filled with regrets. I– I will owe you an enormous debt.
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_023_PACHE_DOUB
I am not sure that I deserve your friendship. I have done something… despicable. They told me to. And now you are my only hope.
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_024_PACHE_IRRI
Everyone continues to ask me for things. You want proof of Danton’s crimes for your own goals, but saving me is not one of them. Forget it.
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_025_PACHE_AGGR
I do not believe you, and like everyone else, you will betray me. You will not get a thing from me. Begone!
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_TOPIC_01
How did he get here?
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_TOPIC_02
What proof does he have of Danton’s misdeeds?
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_TOPIC_03
Where is the proof?
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_TOPIC_04
You can trust me.
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_SUCCESS_001_PACHE
All proof against Danton is hidden in a safe in my office. Ask my assistant for the key.
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_SUCCESS_002_JUDGE
Thank you, Pache. I know what to do with it.
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_SUCCESS_003_PACHE
No, thank you. I misjudged you, Fidèle. You are a true friend.
$CUT_013_DISC_PACHE_SUCCESS_004_JUDGE
Of course, Jean. Of course.
