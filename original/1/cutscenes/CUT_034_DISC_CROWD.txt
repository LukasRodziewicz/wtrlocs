They want to rule!
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_002_CROWD
What are they thinking?!
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_003_CROWD
I’ll beat some sense into my wife later!
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_004_MAN
Just prepare our food and bear our children!
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_005_MAN
No women will rule us!
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_006_CROWD
Remember your place…
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_007_CROWD
… or we will help you!
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_004_JUDGE_AGGR
What they did is disgusting at a time like this, but we have no choice. We have to consent to their demands. At least for now…
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_005_JUDGE_MANI
Admit it, you did not expect this – and neither did I! They attacked when we were not looking, and now we have to give in to them.
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_006_JUDGE_JOKE
All hope is gone… We have to accept their conditions.
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_007_JUDGE_HUMI
Judging by their behaviour, they are extremely determined. They will not give up. This blow will not be the last one if we do not consent to their demands.
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_008_JUDGE_AGGR
It is a trifling amount, Citizens. Give it to them! Do not let your pride and instinct misguide you. Do not be fools!
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_009_JUDGE_MANI
Think on it for a moment – you will give them a small amount of power, yet win yourselves peace for the rest of your lives.
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_010_JUDGE_JOKE
You will give them a few rights that do not matter in the light of changes that have taken place in France recently. It is little more than dust from the Bastille’s ruins.
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_011_JUDGE_HUMI
I know your blood is up, but the truth is, they do not want much. This consent will cost you little.
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_012_CROWD_DOUB
You may have your arguments, but we have ours. Those of men. We have built our world on them, and we will not drop them just like that.
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_013_CROWD_IRRI
Have you had too much to drink again? You are speaking as if we don’t know our women well. They will walk all over us if we consent to this!
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_014_CROWD_AGGR
Give them an inch and they will take a mile. Give them a hand, and they will tear out your heart. Don’t you know what women are like?
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_015_JUDGE_AGGR
There is no time for such discussions, Citizens. The enemy is in the streets, while you ponder whether your wives deserve to stop being treated like servants or slaves!
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_016_JUDGE_MANI
Put yourselves in their shoes. They have not gained much from the Revolution, unlike you, and they end up on the guillotine just as frequently. Who supported you when you were bearing the standards of the Revolution? They carried them at your sides with you!
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_017_JUDGE_JOKE
Is it so difficult to stop the habit of beating your wives? They are often smarter then you, so let them speak, damn it!
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_018_JUDGE_HUMI
Citizens, you must give in. Women deserve better treatment. They have earned their share in the Revolution as much as you gentlemen did. They have suffered enough to get this right.
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_019_CROWD_DOUB
But we can’t treat them any better.
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_020_CROWD_IRRI
We slog our guts out to feed them, we give them children. Don’t we do enough already? It’s said that in savage countries, women have it worse and don’t complain.
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_021_CROWD_AGGR
No, we’ve been too good for them. They should be given the whip and reminded who is the master of the house! Then they won’t feel like rebelling!
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_022_JUDGE_AGGR
If it was not for them, you would never have had your Revolution! Without their support, you would still be mucking out your aristocrats’ stables instead of enjoying every sunrise. They have always stood next to you, but the Revolution did nothing to repay them.
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_023_JUDGE_MANI
Thanks to the Revolution, you men have won equality and freedom, but women have remained in the background. They support us, but as soon as we get our rest, we drive them into a corner! Is this how we want to treat our women?
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_024_JUDGE_JOKE
We have set ourselves up nicely indeed. We seized power from the monarchy, taken it for ourselves, yet our women still wash our dirty undergarments.
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_025_JUDGE_HUMI
The Revolution has not done much for them. They are still in chains, shackled by those who view them as fit only to bear children when they could be warriors and politicians.
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_026_JUDGE_AGGR
Do you want to go back to the old world and the old ways? If not, remember that you shouted the slogan “Freedom. Equality. Brotherhood.” Brotherhood, damn it! What are the slogans worth if you refuse to share what you have with women?
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_027_JUDGE_MANI
You have a chance to show the real power of the Revolutionary brotherhood. Only if we all stand together to fight for our freedom will the slogan “Freedom. Equality. Brotherhood.” be truly fulfilled.
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_028_JUDGE_JOKE
The slogan “Freedom. Equality. Brotherhood.” is now just empty words. At this crucial moment, we cannot deny women the last part of it – brotherhood. If we do that, we may as well shout “Cook. Clean. Bear children.”
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_029_JUDGE_HUMI
The world has changed, Citizens. If you wanted these changes just for yourselves, you could have made sure that no female blood was shed during the Revolution. Only by standing together to fight can we fulfil our dream of a full Revolutionary brotherhood! We owe it to them.
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_030_CROWD_DOUB
Now you’ve confused us. What on earth made you negotiate with hags?
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_031_CROWD_IRRI
If they’re so smart, let’s give them muskets and have them fight against the enemy, how about that? Let’s see if they’re so eager to be equal with us when they see their female friends get their guts torn out by bayonets!
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_032_CROWD_AGGR
You should know better what happens, when you are lenient with women – our own wives will stab us to death the first chance they get if we let them! Or they’ll poison us! We won’t be having any of that!
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_033_MAN
Rule of women…
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_034_CROWD
They can have a brothel – let them rule that.
$CUT_034_DISC_CROWD_035_CROWD
For the glory of the new world!
$CUT_034_DISC_TOPIC_01
We must accept the women’s conditions.
$CUT_034_DISC_TOPIC_02
They are not demanding much.
$CUT_034_DISC_TOPIC_03
They deserve better treatment.
$CUT_034_DISC_TOPIC_04
The Revolution was supposed to give everyone equal status.
$CUT_034_DISC_TOPIC_05
Only a real brotherhood can bring us victory.
