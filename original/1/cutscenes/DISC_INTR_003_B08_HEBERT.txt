We do not control the situation on the streets any more. The chaos can turn on anyone, and we cannot easily pacify the crowds.
$DISC_INTR_003_B08_HEBERT_002_JUDGE_MANI
The situation is beyond our control. A girl was battered yesterday because people suspected that she was spying for the insurgents. Who knows who their next target will be – you, me…
$DISC_INTR_003_B08_HEBERT_003_JUDGE_JOKE
As long as people were throwing rotten tomatoes at random targets, the situation was acceptable. But now they are armed with wooden sticks. I do not know about you, but I am getting scared.
$DISC_INTR_003_B08_HEBERT_004_JUDGE_HUMI
I know that I promised to serve the people and defend liberty, but our Citizens are taking things too far.
$DISC_INTR_003_B08_HEBERT_005_HEBERT_SATI
It is high time that someone moved against this clique. The Revolution was too lenient towards them.
$DISC_INTR_003_B08_HEBERT_006_HEBERT_INTR
Finally, someone has decided to look into those gluttonous idlers. This may be our chance to get rid of those Royalist superstitions.
$DISC_INTR_003_B08_HEBERT_007_HEBERT_DOUB
I almost believed that you were worried about the situation on the streets…
$DISC_INTR_003_B08_HEBERT_008_JUDGE_AGGR
Gobel ruined everything! With a secret like that, he should have been doing everything to make sure it would never get out, and instead he acted like a child!
$DISC_INTR_003_B08_HEBERT_009_JUDGE_MANI
If the rumours prove to be true, Gobel’s presence will make the situation even worse. Do we want people to think the authorities are corrupt? My reputation is at stake, as is yours and your friends’ from the Convention.
$DISC_INTR_003_B08_HEBERT_010_JUDGE_JOKE
Gobel has got himself into hot water at the worst possible moment. Maybe the Pope has finally had his revenge? God has listened to his prayers and decided to punish the archbishop for being appointed constitutionally…
$DISC_INTR_003_B08_HEBERT_011_JUDGE_HUMI
I do not want to make convictions in absentia, but it seems to me that the anger of the people has revealed some old secrets – like that of Archbishop Gobel. Maybe we should do something about it?
$DISC_INTR_003_B08_HEBERT_012_HEBERT_SATI
Nothing would please me more than to watch the fall of this progress-hindering priest. Well, maybe destroying the institution of the Pope would be even sweeter.
$DISC_INTR_003_B08_HEBERT_013_HEBERT_INTR
You know how to appeal to a person’s deepest dreams. There is no point pretending I would not be glad if Gobel left the world of the living and made room for the rule of reason… How can I help?
$DISC_INTR_003_B08_HEBERT_014_HEBERT_DOUB
The Paris Commune wanted to get to that bloated pig a long time ago and nobody cared. Now that people have realised they can benefit from his fall, everyone wants his head.
$DISC_INTR_003_B08_HEBERT_015_JUDGE_AGGR
We cannot pay for the behaviour of one group. With all its lies and degeneration, the Church have worked hard for the anger of the people. Let us cut it off and live our lives in peace.
$DISC_INTR_003_B08_HEBERT_016_JUDGE_MANI
The angry tiger should get some prey to rip apart, then he will not pay attention to anything else and we will be able to live in peace. Since the tiger wants to sink its teeth into the clergy…
$DISC_INTR_003_B08_HEBERT_017_JUDGE_JOKE
We really do not have another choice. They want the clergy, so let us give it to them. If they are accusing the clergy of treason, then we should echo their words. Simple and efficient.
$DISC_INTR_003_B08_HEBERT_018_JUDGE_HUMI
I am against hurting the Church. It hurts itself through the hands of degenerates who are cursed by our Citizens. We need to cut ties with that entire group. For the greater good.
$DISC_INTR_003_B08_HEBERT_019_HEBERT_SATI
Reason shall prevail over superstition. You have my support, monsieur le juge.
$DISC_INTR_003_B08_HEBERT_020_HEBERT_INTR
I do wonder how all this will end, but regardless of my doubts, you can count on my help.
$DISC_INTR_003_B08_HEBERT_021_HEBERT_DOUB
Due to your unclear motives, the Paris Commune and the rule of reason has more to lose than it will gain here. I am sorry.
$DISC_INTR_003_B08_HEBERT_TOPIC_01
The situation on the street is becoming difficult to control.
$DISC_INTR_003_B08_HEBERT_TOPIC_02
The trouble with Gobel has only poured salt on the wound.
$DISC_INTR_003_B08_HEBERT_TOPIC_03
Someone should be punished to set an example.
