Why the hell have I been kidnapped and tied to a chair?!
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_002_CARON
There are many whores in Paris willing to play that game with you. So, judge, will you answer me?
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_003_CARON
Or do you want me to watch you playing with yourself, you dirty old man?
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_004_CARON
Nothing, hmm?
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_005_CARON
I’ve heard that someone’s been trying to kill you.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_006_CARON
And now you’ve been promoted to the elite group of murderers, the princes of the guillotine.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_007_CARON
Congratulations.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_008_JUDGE
I never asked to be admitted to the club, but I did not get there accidentally either.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_009_CARON
Yes, I can imagine you need a special something for that.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_010_CARON
Ah, that sparkle of masculine madness in your eyes.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_011_JUDGE
You have to sign this document.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_012_CARON
Is that a story? Any interesting turning points?
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_013_JUDGE
Treason and spying for Austria, carried out by you and the Mayor of Paris.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_014_CARON
Such an exaggerated drama…
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_015_CARON
It won’t sell.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_010_JUDGE_AGGR
In this document, I prove that you are a corrupt whore, and you will find I am quite the writer. Listen to me, your health is at stake here.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_011_JUDGE_MANI
This document will bear your signature, one way or another.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_012_JUDGE_JOKE
I am an excellent publisher, I can sell any story. Sign this document quickly, the boys would like to get off guard duty now.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_013_JUDGE_HUMI
I would rather not see you smile. This document is a formal necessity, and it is too bad we have to sign it under such circumstances.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_014_CARON_DOUB
Somehow, I feel no urge to sign anything.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_015_CARON_IRRI
Perhaps my irony wasn’t clear enough. I have no intention of signing any documents, so you can stuff that somewhere uncomfortable. You can’t force me.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_016_CARON_AGGR
I don’t care what you must do or what you don’t want to do. I’m not afraid of you. A large number of the Citizens here in Paris will stand by me.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_017_JUDGE_AGGR
You have been betrayed by the Muscadins They told us about your romance with the mayor’s daughter. Once Pache learns about everything, believe me, he will do his best to see you put to death. There is no one standing by your side…
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_018_JUDGE_MANI
Can you see anyone here who would stand by you? Has anyone come to help you? No. Only I can help you.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_019_JUDGE_JOKE
Your freedom is only a signature away. Why not do it? The mayor will feel the consequences of the document considerably more than you.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_020_JUDGE_HUMI
Following the orders of those who are superior to us is something we do constantly in our lives. You would not want to stand in their way, as they will trample over you without even noticing.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_021_JUDGE_AGGR
Do you see those guards? I could leave you alone with them for an hour. Most probably they will rape you, maybe beat you up. Is that what must happen to make the scales fall from your eyes?
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_022_JUDGE_MANI
You love Marie, yes? Then I will give you a choice. Do I guillotine her, or her father? I do not care which of them dies, as long as that family pays for the assassination attempt on me.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_023_JUDGE_JOKE
However it happens, your signature will be on the testimony. The paper will not care if the pen is held in a dead hand.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_024_JUDGE_HUMI
The mayor will kill you if your romance with his daughter is made public and threatens his reputation. He tried to neutralise me as well when my actions became dangerous for his business.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_025_JUDGE_AGGR
This is your only chance for starting a new life. When you leave this room, you will die, but even here you are threatened by death, as my patience is nearing an end.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_026_JUDGE_MANI
Leave Paris. Escape the storm that will otherwise not spare you, and is indifferent to your feelings for Marie. America is a good place, and the shadow of the Revolution will not reach you there. Sign this document. Escape while you still can.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_027_JUDGE_JOKE
Think of it as an opportunity to begin a new life. Buy yourself something fancy to wear and run from the city that never was, and never will be, on your side.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_028_JUDGE_HUMI
When things calm down, it will be like nothing ever happened. Sometimes you must suffer to save yourself. To save a loved one.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_029_CARON_INTR
Can you guarantee that my new life won’t be abruptly ended by an accident? That I will not mysteriously run into a knife, or fall beneath the wheels of a cart?
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_030_CARON_DOUB
Do I look like someone who is terribly concerned about their own life or other people’s opinions?
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_031_CARON_IRRI
…
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_032_CARON_AGGR
I am not some whore. You have misjudged me, I am too proud for that.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_033_JUDGE_AGGR
For the people of Paris, you will be just another anomaly. They will be like street dogs, tearing apart your meat and tendons for the pleasure of it.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_034_JUDGE_MANI
America is a good place for you, it is a new world, and not fully formed yet. Here, the people understand freedom only within the limits of their imagination.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_035_JUDGE_JOKE
Do you expect France to accept two women in a relationship, like you and Marie? The Revolution has changed the form of rule, but the people have remained the same, and they did not fight for freedom for something they do not understand.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_036_JUDGE_HUMI
France will not give you and Marie the freedom that you need. You can shout and rebel against it all you wish, but you will pay for this with your life. And on the guillotine, you will only hear the crowd shouting, “Freak.”
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_037_CARON_INTR
Perhaps it really would be better if I left this deceitful country that only pretends the Revolution has brought us to salvation.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_038_CARON_DOUB
And you are just and forgiving? Do you understand us? France is a man, you will never feel our pain. You are monsters… all of you.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_039_CARON_IRRI
You are all the same. That little bit of freedom I have left will be enough to oppose anything you want from me.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_040_CARON_AGGR
The Revolution is simply a change of guards. The rest will subordinate themselves or fall into the chasm. I won’t accept this, I can’t stand it any longer!
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_TOPIC_01
What do we need?

Why she should sign [RATIONALLY].

Why she should sign [THREAT].
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_TOPIC_04
What will she get out of it?
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_TOPIC_05
France will not accept the union of two women.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_DECISION_01
Torture
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_EVE_DECISION_01
We would all be happier if Béatrice were more reasonable. Her stubbornness stands in the way of your revenge. Showing her mercy, you risk that Pache will attack you again one day, you or your family. This city does not forgive the weak. The tortures have broken the girl and she signed the testimony. Let us hope that Danton will be less resistant.
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_DECISION_02
Pay for the escape using family savings
$CUT_042_DISC_CARON_EVE_DECISION_02
You should have thought about that from the start. You should have known. People like her do not believe in promises – they have seen too many of them broken in their lives. They are not afraid of threats because they have long learned to live in constant fear and anxiety. Money – that is the only thing Béatrice believes in. Money and a new life. She signed the testimony, you got what you wanted. Now what will your family say when they notice the family budget has been depleted?
